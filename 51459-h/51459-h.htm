<h4><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h4>


<p>If a preface was ever necessary, it may very likely
be thought so to the following work; the title of
which (in the proposals publish'd some time since)
hath much amused, and raised the expectation of the
curious, though not without a mixture of doubt, that
its purport could ever be satisfactorily answered. For
though beauty is seen and confessed by all, yet, from
the many fruitless attempts to account for the cause of
its being so, enquiries on this head have almost been
given up; and the subject generally thought to be a
matter of too high and too delicate a nature to admit of
any true or intelligible discussion. Something therefore
introductory ought to be said at the presenting a work
with a face so entirely new; especially as it will naturally
encounter with, and perhaps may overthrow,
several long received and thorough establish'd opinions:
and since controversies may arise how far, and after
what manner this subject hath hitherto been consider'd
and treated, it will also be proper to lay before the
reader, what may be gathered concerning it, from the
works of the ancient and modern writers and painters.</p>

<p>It is no wonder this subject should have so long
been thought inexplicable, since the nature of many
parts of it cannot possibly come within the reach of
mere men of letters; otherwise those ingenious gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
who have lately published treatises upon it (and
who have written much more learnedly than can be
expected from one who never took up the pen before)
would not so soon have been bewilder'd in their accounts
of it, and obliged so suddenly to turn into the
broad, and more beaten path of moral beauty; in order
to extricate themselves out of the difficulties they seem
to have met with in this: and withal forced for the
same reasons to amuse their readers with amazing (but
often misapplied) encomiums on deceased painters and
their performances; wherein they are continually discoursing
of effects instead of developing causes; and
after many prettinesses, in very pleasing language, do
fairly set you down just where they first took you up;
honestly confessing that as to <span class="smcap">grace</span>, the main point in
question, they do not even pretend to know any thing
of the matter. And indeed how should they? when it
actually requires a practical knowledge of the whole art
of painting (sculpture alone not being sufficient) and
that too to some degree of eminence, in order to enable
any one to pursue the chain of this enquiry through all
its parts: which I hope will be made to appear in the
following work.</p>

<p>It will then naturally be asked, why the best painters
within these two centuries, who by their works appear
to have excelled in grace and beauty, should have been
so silent in an affair of such seeming importance to the
imitative arts and their own honour? to which I answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
that it is probable, they arrived at that excellence
in their works, by the mere dint of imitating with great
exactness the beauties of nature, and by often copying
and retaining strong ideas of graceful antique statues;
which might sufficiently serve their purposes as painters,
without their troubling themselves with a farther enquiry
into the particular causes of the effects before
them. It is not indeed a little strange, that the great
Leonardo da Vinci (amongst the many philosophical
precepts which he hath at random laid down in his
treatise on painting) should not have given the least hint
of any thing tending to a system of this kind; especially,
as he was cotemporary with Michael Angelo, who is
said to have discover'd a certain principle in the trunk
only of an antique statue, (well known from this circumstance
by the name of Michael Angelo's Torso, or
Back, fig. 54 p. I) which principle gave his works a grandeur
of gusto equal to the best antiques. Relative to which
tradition, Lomazzo who wrote about painting at the
same time, hath this remarkable passage, vol. I. book I.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/54.jpg" width="301" height="257" alt="54" />
</div>

<p>"And because in this place there falleth out a certaine
precept of <i>Michael Angelo</i> much for our purpose,
I wil not conceale it, leaving the farther interpretation
and vnderstanding thereof to the iudicious
reader. It is reported then that <i>Michael Angelo</i> vpon
a time gaue this observation to the Painter <i>Marcus
de Sciena</i> his scholler; <i>that he should alwaies make
a figure Pyramidall, Serpentlike, and multiplied by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
two and three</i>. In which precept (in mine opinion)
the whole mysterie of the arte consisteth. For the
greatest grace and life that a picture can haue, is,
that it expresse <i>Motion</i>: which the Painters call the
<i>spirite</i> of a picture: Nowe there is no forme so fitte
to expresse this <i>motion</i>, as that of the flame of fire,
which according to <i>Aristotle</i> and the other Philosophers,
is an elemente most actiue of all others: because
the forme of the flame thereof is most apt for
motion: for it hath a <i>Conus</i> or sharpe pointe wherewith
it seemeth to divide the aire, that so it may ascende
to his proper sphere. So that a picture having
this forme will bee most beautifull."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See Haydock's translation printed at Oxford, 1598.</p></div>

<p>Many writers since Lomazzo have in the same words
recommended the observing this rule also; without comprehending
the meaning of it: for unless it were known
systematically, the whole business of grace could not
be understood.</p>

<p>Du Fresnoy, in his art of painting, says "large flowing,
gliding outlines which are in waves, give not
only a grace to the part, but to the whole body; as
we see in the Antinous, and in many other of the antique
figures: a fine figure and its parts ought always
to have a serpent-like and flaming form: naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
those sort of lines have I know not what of life and
seeming motion in them, which very much resembles
the activity of the flame and of the serpent." Now
if he had understood what he had said, he could not,
speaking of grace, have expressed himself in the following
contradictory manner.&mdash;"But to say the truth, this
is a difficult undertaking, and a rare present, which
the artist rather receives from the hand of heaven
than from his own industry and studies<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>." But De
Piles, in his lives of the painters, is still more contradictory,
where he says, "that a painter can only have it
(meaning grace) from nature, and doth not know
that he hath it, nor in what degree, nor how he
communicates it to his works: and that grace and
beauty are two different things; beauty pleases by
the rules, and grace without them."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> See Dryden's translation of his latin poem on Painting, verse 28,
and the remarks on these very lines, page 155, which run thus, "It is
difficult to say what this grace of painting is, it is to be conceiv'd,
and understood much more easy than to be expressed by words; it proceeds
from the illuminations of an excellent mind, (but not to be acquired)
by which we give a certain turn to things, which makes them
pleasing."</p></div>

<p>All the English writers on this subject have echo'd
these passages; hence <i>Je ne sçai quoi</i>, is become a fashionable
phrase for grace.</p>

<p>By this it is plain, that this precept which Michael
Angelo deliver'd so long ago in an oracle-like manner,
hath remain'd mysterious down to this time, for ought
that has appear'd to the contrary. The wonder that it
should do so will in some measure lessen when we come
to consider that it must all along have appeared as full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
of contradiction as the most obscure quibble ever deliver'd
at Delphos, because, <i>winding lines are as often the
cause of deformity as of grace</i>, the solution of which, in
this place, would be an anticipation of what the reader
will find at large in the body of the work.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/a.jpg" width="200" height="223" alt="fig between 22 and 105" />
</div>

<p>There are also strong prejudices in favour of straight
lines, as constituting true beauty in the human form,
where they never should appear. A middling connoisseur
thinks no profile has beauty without a very straight nose,
and if the forehead be continued straight with it, he thinks
it is still more sublime. I have seen miserable scratches
with the pen, sell at a considerable rate for only having
in them a side face or two, like that between fig. 22,
and fig. 105, plate I, which was made, and any one
might do the same, with the eyes shut. The common
notion that a person should be straight as an arrow, and
perfectly erect is of this kind. If a dancing-master were
to see his scholar in the easy and gracefully-turned attitude
of the Antinous (fig. 6, plate I,) he would cry
shame on him, and tell him he looked as crooked as a
ram's horn, and bid him hold up his head as he himself
did. See fig. 7, plate I.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 265px;">
<img src="images/6-7.jpg" width="265" height="367" alt="figs 6 and 7" />
</div>

<p>The painters, in like manner, by their works, seem
to be no less divided upon the subject than the authors.
The French, except such as have imitated the antique,
or the Italian school, seem to have studiously avoided
the serpentine line in all their pictures, especially Anthony
Coypel, history painter, and Rigaud, principal
portrait painter to Lewis the 14th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>Rubens, whose manner of designing was quite original,
made use of a large flowing line as a principle,
which runs through all his works, and gives a noble
spirit to them; but he did not seem to be acquainted
with what we call the <i>precise line</i>; which hereafter we
shall be very particular upon, and which gives the delicacy
we see in the best Italian masters; but he rather
charged his contours in general with too bold and S-like
swellings.</p>

<p>Raphael, from a straight and stiff manner, on a sudden
changed his taste of lines at sight of Michael Angelo's
works, and the antique statues; and so fond was he of
the serpentine line, that he carried it into a ridiculous
excess, particularly in his draperies: though his great
observance of nature suffer'd him not long to continue
in this mistake.</p>

<p>Peter de Cortone form'd a fine manner in his draperies
of this line.</p>

<p>We see this principle no where better understood than
in some pictures of Corregio, particularly his Juno and
Ixion: yet the proportions of his figures are sometimes
such as might be corrected by a common sign painter.</p>

<p>Whilst Albert Durer, who drew mathematically,
never so much as deviated into grace, which he must
sometimes have done in copying the life, if he had not
been fetter'd with his own impracticable rules of proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>But that which may have puzzled this matter most,
may be, that Vandyke, one of the best portrait painters
in most respects ever known, plainly appears not to have
had a thought of this kind. For there seems not to be
the least grace in his pictures more than what the life
chanced to bring before him. There is a print of the
Dutchess of Wharton (fig. 52, plate II,) engraved by
Van Gunst, from a true picture by him, which is thoroughly
divested of every elegance. Now, had he known
this line as a principle, he could no more have drawn
all the parts of this picture so contrary to it, than Mr.
Addison could have wrote a whole spectator in false
grammar; unless it were done on purpose. However,
on account of his other great excellencies, painters
chuse to stile this want of grace in his attitudes, &amp;c.
<i>simplicity</i>, and indeed they do often very justly merit
that epithet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/52.jpg" width="102" height="281" alt="52" />
</div>

<p>Nor have the painters of the present times been less
uncertain and contradictory to each other, than the
masters already mentioned, whatever they may pretend
to the contrary: of this I had a mind to be certain, and
therefore, in the year 1745, published a frontispiece to
my engraved works, in which I drew a serpentine line
lying on a painter's pallet, with these words under it,
<span class="smcap">the line of beauty</span>. The bait soon took; and no
Egyptian hierogliphic ever amused more than it did for
a time, painters and sculptors came to me to know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
meaning of it, being as much puzzled with it as other
people, till it came to have some explanation; then
indeed, but not till then, some found it out to be
an old acquaintance of theirs, tho' the account they
could give of its properties was very near as satisfactory
as that which a day-labourer who constantly uses the
leaver, could give of that machine as a mechanical
power.</p>

<p>Others, as common face painters and copiers of pictures,
denied that there could be such a rule either in
art or nature, and asserted it was all stuff and madness;
but no wonder that these gentlemen should not be
ready in comprehending a thing they have little or no
business with. For though the <i>picture copier</i> may sometimes
to a common eye seem to vye with the original
he copies, the artist himself requires no more ability,
genius, or knowledge of nature, than a journeyman-weaver
at the goblins, who in working after a piece of
painting, bit by bit, scarcely knows what he is about,
whether he is weaving a man or a horse, yet at last
almost insensibly turns out of his loom a fine piece of
tapestry, representing, it may be, one of Alexander's
battles painted by Le Brun.</p>

<p>As the above-mention'd print thus involved me in
frequent disputes by explaining the qualities of the
line, I was extremely glad to find it (which I had
conceiv'd as only part of a system in my mind) so well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
supported by the above precept of Michael Angelo:
which was first pointed out to me by Dr. Kennedy, a
learned antiquarian and connoisseur, of whom I afterwards
purchased the translation, from which I have
taken several passages to my purpose.</p>

<p>Let us now endeavour to discover what light antiquity
throws upon the subject in question.</p>

<p>Egypt first, and afterward Greece, have manifested
by their works their great skill in arts and sciences, and
among the rest painting, and sculpture, all which are
thought to have issued from their great schools of philosophy.
Pythagoras, Socrates, and Aristotle, seem to
have pointed out the right road in nature for the study
of the painters and sculptors of those times (which they
in all probability afterwards followed through those
nicer paths that their particular professions required
them to pursue) as may be reasonably collected from the
answers given by Socrates to Aristippus his disciple, and
Parrhasius the painter, concerning <span class="smcap">fitness</span>, the first
fundamental law in nature with regard to beauty.</p>

<p>I am in some measure saved the trouble of collecting
an historical account of these arts among the ancients,
by accidentally meeting with a preface to a tract, call'd
the <i>Beau Ideal</i>: this treatise<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was written by Lambert
Hermanson Ten Kate, in French, and translated into
English by James Christopher le Blon; who in that
preface says, speaking of the Author, "His superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
knowledge that I am now publishing, is the product
of the Analogy of the ancient Greeks; or the true
key for finding all harmonious proportions in painting,
sculpture, architecture, musick, &amp;c. brought
home to Greece by Pythagoras. For after this great
philosopher had travell'd into Phoenicia, Egypt and
Chaldea, where he convers'd with the learned; he
return'd into Greece about Anno Mundi 3484. Before
the christian æra 520, and brought with him
many excellent discoveries and improvements for the
good of his countrymen, among which the Analogy
was one of the most considerable and useful.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Publish'd in 1732, and sold by A. Millar.</p></div>

<p>"After him the Grecians, by the help of this Analogy,
began (and not before) to excel other nations
in sciences and arts; for whereas before this time
they represented their <i>Divinities</i> in plain human figures,
the Grecians now began to enter into the Beau
Ideal; and Pamphilus, (who flourish'd A. M. 3641,
before the christian æra 363, who taught, that no man
could excel in painting without mathematicks) the
scholar of Pausias and master of Apelles, was the first
who artfully apply'd the said Analogy to the art of
painting; as much about the same time the sculpturers,
the architects, &amp;c. began to apply it to their
several arts, without which science, the Grecians had
remain'd as ignorant as their forefathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>"They carried on their improvements in drawing,
painting, architecture, sculpture, &amp;c. till
they became the wonders of the world; especially
after the Asiaticks and Egyptians (who had
formerly been the teachers of the Grecians) had,
in process of time and by the havock of war,
lost all the excellency in sciences and arts; for
which all other nations were afterwards obliged
to the Grecians, without being able so much as to
imitate them.</p>

<p>"For when the Romans had conquered Greece and Asia,
and had brought to Rome the best paintings and the
finest artists, we don't find they discovered the
great key of knowledge, the Analogy I am now speaking
of, but their best performances were conducted by
Grecian artists, who it seems cared not to communicate
their secret of the Analogy; because either they
intended to be necessary at Rome, by keeping the
secret among themselves, or else the Romans, who
principally affected universal dominion, were not
curious enough to search after the secret, not
knowing the importance of it, nor understanding
that, without it, they could never attain to the
excellency of the Grecians: though nevertheless it
must be owned that the Romans used well the proportions,
which the Grecians long before had reduced to certain
fixed rules according to their ancient Analogy; and
the Romans could arrive at the happy use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
proportions, without comprehending the Analogy itself."</p>

<p>This account agrees with what is constantly observed in
Italy, where the Greek, and Roman work, both in medals
and statues, are as distinguishable as the characters
of the two languages.</p>

<p>As the preface had thus been of service to me, I
was in hopes from the title of the book (and the
assurance of the translator, that the author had
by his great learning discovered the secret of the
ancients) to have met with something there that
might have assisted, or confirmed the scheme I had
in hand; but was much disappointed in finding nothing
of that sort, and no explanation, or even after-mention
of what at first agreeably alarmed me, the word
<i>Analogy</i>. I have given the reader a specimen, in his own
words, how far the author has discovered this grand
secret of the ancients, or <i>great key of knowledge</i>,
as the translator calls it.</p>

<p>"The sublime part that I so much esteem, and of which
I have begun to speak, is a real <i>Je ne sçai quoi</i>, or
an unaccountable something to most people, and it is
the most important part to all the connoisseurs, I
shall call it an harmonious propriety, which is a
touching or moving unity, or a pathetick agreement
or concord, not only of each member to its body,
but also of each part to the member of which it is
a part: <i>It is also an infinite variety of parts</i>, however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
conformable, with respect to each different subject,
so that all the attitude, and all the adjustment of the
draperies of each figure ought to answer or correspond
to the subject chosen. Briefly, it is a true decorum,
a bienseance or a congruent disposition of
ideas, as well for the face and stature, as for the
attitudes. A bright genius, in my opinion, who
aspires to excel in the ideal, should propose this to
himself, as what has been the principal study of the
most famous artists. 'Tis in this part that the great
masters cannot be imitated or copied but by themselves,
or by those that are advanced in the knowledge
of the ideal, and who are as knowing as those
masters in the rules or laws of the pittoresque and
poetical nature, altho' inferior to the masters in the
high spirit of invention."</p>

<p>The words in this quotation "<i>It is also an infinite
variety of parts</i>," seem at first to have some meaning in
them, but it is entirely destroy'd by the rest of the paragraph,
and all the other pages are filled, according to
custom, with descriptions of pictures.</p>

<p>Now, as every one has a right to conjecture what
this discovery of the ancients might be, it shall be my
business to shew it was a key to the thorough knowledge
of variety both in form, and movement. Shakespear,
who had the deepest penetration into nature, has
sum'd up all the charms of beauty in two words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">infinite variety</span>; where, speaking of Cleopatra's
power over Anthony, he says,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
&mdash;&mdash;Nor custom stale<br />
Her infinite variety:&mdash;&mdash; Act 2. Scene 3.<br />

<p>It has been ever observed, that the ancients made
their doctrines mysterious to the vulgar, and kept them
secret from those who were not of their particular sects,
and societies, by means of symbols, and hieroglyphics.
Lomazzo says, chap. 29, book 1. "The Grecians in
imitation of antiquity searched out the truly renowned
proportion, wherein the exact perfection of
most exquisite beauty and sweetness appeareth; dedicating
the same in a triangular glass unto Venus
the goddess of divine beauty, from whence all the
beauty of inferior things is derived."</p>

<p>If we suppose this passage to be authentic, may we
not also imagine it probable, that the symbol in the
triangular glass, might be similar to the line Michael
Angelo recommended; especially, if it can be proved,
that the triangular form of the glass, and the serpentine
line itself, are the two most expressive figures that can
be thought of to signify not only beauty and grace, but
the whole <i>order of form</i>.</p>

<p>There is a circumstance in the account Pliny gives
of Apelles's visit to Protogenes, which strengthens this
supposition. I hope I may have leave to repeat the story.
Apelles having heard of the fame of Protogenes, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
to Rhodes to pay him a visit, but not finding him at
home asked for a board, on which he drew a <i>line</i>, telling
the servant maid, that line would signify to her master
who had been to see him; we are not clearly told what
sort of a line it was that could so particularly signify
one of the first of his profession: if it was only a stroke
(tho' as fine as a hair as Pliny seems to think) it could
not possibly, by any means, denote the abilities of a great
painter. But if we suppose it to be a line of some
extraordinary quality, such as the serpentine line will
appear to be, Apelles could not have left a more satisfactory
signature of the complement he had paid him.
Protogenes when he came home took the hint, and
drew a finer <i>or rather more expressive line</i> within it, to
shew Apelles if he came again, that he understood his
meaning. He, soon returning, was well-pleased with the
answer Protogenes had left for him, by which he was
convinced that fame had done him justice, and so correcting
the line again, perhaps by making it more precisely
elegant, he took his leave. The story thus may
be reconcil'd to common sense, which, as it has been
generally receiv'd, could never be understood but as a
ridiculous tale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/b.jpg" width="250" height="256" alt="fig over fig 4 pl I" />
</div>

<p>Let us add to this, that there is scarce an Egyptian,
Greek, or Roman deity, but hath a twisted serpent,
twisted cornucopia, or some symbol winding in this
manner to accompany it. The two small heads (over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
busto of the Hercules, fig. 4, in plate I) of the goddess
Isis, one crowned with a globe between two horns, the
other with a lily<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, are of this kind. Harpocrates, the
god of silence, is still more remarkably so, having a large
twisted horn growing out of the side of his head, one
cornucopia in his hand, and another at his feet, with
his finger placed on his lips, indicating secrecy: (see Montfaucon's
antiquities) and it is as remarkable, that the
deities of barbarous and gothic nations never had, nor
have to this day, any of these elegant forms belonging
to them. How absolutely void of these turns are the
pagods of China, and what a mean taste runs through
most of their attempts in painting and sculpture, notwithstanding
they finish with such excessive neatness;
the whole nation in these matters seem to have but one
eye: this mischief naturally follows from the prejudices
they imbibe by copying one anothers works, which the
ancients seem seldom to have done.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The leaves of this flower as they grow, twist themselves various ways
in a pleasing manner, as may be better seen by figure 43, in plate I, but
there is a curious little flower called the Autumn Syclamen, fig. 47, the
leaves of which elegantly twist one way only.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/43-47.jpg" width="400" height="274" alt="figs 43 and 47" />
</div>

<p>Upon the whole, it is evident, that the ancients studied
these arts very differently from the moderns: Lomazzo
seems to be partly aware of this, by what he
says in the division of his work, page 9, "There is a
two-folde proceeding in all artes and sciences: the
one is called the order of nature, and the other of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
teaching. Nature proceedeth ordinarily, beginning
with the unperfect, as the particulars, and ending with
the perfect, as the universals. Now if in searching
out the nature of things, our understanding shall
proceede after that order, by which they are brought
forth by nature, doubtlesse it will be the most absolute
and ready method that can bee imagined. For
we beginne to know things by their first and immediate
principles, &amp;c. and this is not only mine opinion
but Aristotles also," yet, mistaking Aristotle's
meaning, and absolutely deviating from his advice, he
afterwards says, "all which if we could comprehend
within our understanding, we should be most wise;
but it is <i>impossible</i>," and after having given some dark
reasons why he thinks so, he tells you "he resolves to
follow the order of teaching," which all the writers
on painting have in like manner since done.</p>

<p>Had I observed the foregoing passage, before I undertook
this essay, it probably would have put me to a
stand, and deterred me from venturing upon what Lomazzo
calls an impossible task: but observing in the
foremention'd controversies that the torrent generally
ran against me; and that several of my opponents had
turn'd my arguments into ridicule, yet were daily availing
themselves of their use, and venting them even to
my face as their own; I began to wish the publication
of something on this subject; and accordingly applied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
myself to several of my friends, whom I thought capable
of taking up the pen for me, offering to furnish them
with materials by word of mouth: but finding this method
not practicable, from the difficulty of one man's
expressing the ideas of another, especially on a subject
which he was either unacquainted with, or was new in
its kind, I was therefore reduced to an attempt of finding
such words as would best answer my own ideas,
being now too far engaged to drop the design. Hereupon,
having digested the matter as well as I could,
and thrown it into the form of a book, I submitted it
to the judgment of such friends whose sincerity and
abilities I could best rely on, determining on their approbation
or dislike to publish or destroy it: but their
favourable opinion of the manuscript being publicly
known, it gave such a credit to the undertaking, as
soon changed the countenances of those, who had a
better opinion of my pencil, than my pen, and turn'd
their sneers into expectation: especially when the same
friends had kindly made me an offer of conducting the
work through the press. And here I must acknowledge
myself particularly indebted to one gentleman for his
corrections and amendment of at least a third part of
the wording. Through his absence and avocations,
several sheets went to the press without any assistance,
and the rest had the occasional inspection of one or two
other friends. If any inaccuracies shall be found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
the writing, I shall readily acknowledge them all my
own, and am, I confess, under no great concern about
them, provided the matter in general may be found
useful and answerable in the application of it to truth
and nature; in which material points, if the reader
shall think fit to rectify any mistakes, it will give me a
sensible pleasure, and be doing great honour to the
work.</p>

<h4><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h4>


<p>I now offer to the public a short essay, accompanied
with two explanatory prints, in which I
shall endeavour to shew what the principles are in
nature, by which we are directed to call the forms of
some bodies beautiful, others ugly; some graceful, and
others the reverse; by considering more minutely than
has hitherto been done, the nature of those lines, and
their different combinations, which serve to raise in
the mind the ideas of all the variety of forms imaginable.
At first, perhaps, the whole design, as well as the
prints, may seem rather intended to trifle and confound,
than to entertain and inform: but I am persuaded
that when the examples in nature, referr'd to in
this essay, are duly consider'd and examined upon the
principles laid down in it, it will be thought worthy of a
careful and attentive perusal: and the prints themselves
too will, I make no doubt, be examined as attentively,
when it is found, that almost every figure in them (how
odly soever they may seem to be group'd together) is
referr'd to singly in the essay, in order to assist the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
reader's imagination, when the original examples in art,
or nature, are not themselves before him.</p>

<p>And in this light I hope my prints will be consider'd,
and that the figures referr'd to in them will
never be imagined to be placed there by me as examples
themselves, of beauty or grace, but only to point
out to the reader what sorts of objects he is to look for
and examine in nature, or in the works of the greatest
masters. My figures, therefore, are to be consider'd in
the same light, with those a mathematician makes
with his pen, which may convey the idea of his demonstration,
tho' not a line in them is either perfectly
straight, or of that peculiar curvature he is treating of.
Nay, so far was I from aiming at grace, that I purposely
chose to be least accurate, where most beauty
might be expected, that no stress might be laid on the
figures to the prejudice of the work itself. For I must
confess, I have but little hopes of having a favourable
attention given to my design in general, by those who
have already had a more fashionable introduction into
the mysteries of the arts of painting, and sculpture.
Much less do I expect, or in truth desire, the countenance
of that set of people, who have an interest in
exploding any kind of doctrine, that may teach us to
<i>see with our own eyes</i>.</p>

<p>It may be needless to observe, that some of the last-mention'd,
are not only the dependents on, but often
the only instructors and leaders of the former; but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
what light they are so consider'd abroad, may be partly
seen by [Fig. 1 T p. I] a burlesque representation of them, taken
from a print publish'd by Mr. Pond, design'd by Cav<sup>r</sup>.
Ghezzi at Rome.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/1.jpg" width="233" height="223" alt="1" />
</div>

<p>To those, then, whose judgments are unprejudiced, this
little work is submitted with most pleasure; because it
is from such that I have hitherto received the most obligations,
and now have reason to expect most candour.</p>

<p>Therefore I would fain have such of my readers be
assured, that however they may have been aw'd, and
over-born by pompous terms of art, hard names, and
the parade of seemingly magnificent collections of pictures
and statues; they are in a much fairer way, ladies,
as well as gentlemen, of gaining a perfect knowledge of
the elegant and beautiful in artificial, as well as natural
forms, by considering them in a systematical, but at
the same time familiar way, than those who have
been prepossess'd by dogmatic rules, taken from the
performances of art only: nay, I will venture to say,
sooner, and more rationally, than even a tolerable
painter, who has imbibed the same prejudices.</p>

<p>The more prevailing the notion may be, that painters
and connoisseurs are the only competent judges of things
of this sort; the more it becomes necessary to clear up
and confirm, as much as possible, what has only been
asserted in the foregoing paragraph: that no one may
be deterr'd, by the want of such previous knowledge,
from entring into this enquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason why gentlemen, who have been inquisitive
after knowledge in pictures, have their eyes less
qualified for our purpose, than others, is because their
thoughts have been entirely and continually employ'd
and incumber'd with considering and retaining the various
<i>manners</i> in which pictures are painted, the histories,
names, and characters of the masters, together
with many other little circumstances belonging to the
mechanical part of the art; and little or no time has
been given for perfecting the ideas they ought to have
in their minds, of the objects themselves in nature: for
by having thus espoused and adopted their first notions
from nothing but <i>imitations</i>, and becoming too often
as bigotted to their faults, as their beauties, they at
length, in a manner, totally neglect, or at least disregard
the works of nature, merely because they do not tally
with what their minds are so strongly prepossess'd with.</p>

<p>Were not this a true state of the case, many a reputed
capital picture, that now adorns the cabinets of
the curious in all countries, would long ago have been
committed to the flames: nor would it have been possible
for the Venus and Cupid, represented by the figure [under Fig. 49 T p. I],
to have made its way into the principal apartment
of a palace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/c.jpg" width="335" height="180" alt="fig. under 49 pl.I" />
</div>

<p>It is also evident that the painter's eye may not be a
bit better fitted to receive these new impressions, who
is in like manner too much captivated with the works
of art; for he also is apt to pursue the shadow, and drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
the substance. This mistake happens chiefly to those
who go to Rome for the accomplishment of their studies;
as they naturally will, without the utmost care,
take the infectious turn of the connoisseur, instead of the
painter: and in proportion as they turn by those means
bad proficients in their own arts, they become the more
considerable in that of a connoisseur. As a confirmation
of this seeming paradox, it has ever been observ'd
at all auctions of pictures, that the very worst painters
sit as the most profound judges, and are trusted only, I
suppose, on account of their <i>disinterestedness</i>.</p>

<p>I apprehend a good deal of this will look more like
resentment, and a design to invalidate the objections of
such as are not likely to set the faults of this work in the
most favourable light; than merely for the encouragement,
as was said above, of such of my readers, as are
neither painters, nor connoisseurs: and I will be ingenuous
enough to confess something of this may be
true; but, at the same time, I cannot allow that this
alone would have been a sufficient motive to have made
me risk giving offence to any; had not another consideration,
besides that already alledg'd, of more consequence
to the purpose in hand, made it necessary. I
mean the setting forth, in the strongest colours, the
alterations objects seemingly undergo through
the prepossessions and prejudices contracted by the mind.&mdash;&mdash;Fallacies,
strongly to be guarded against by such as
would learn to see objects truly!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>Altho' the instances already given are pretty flagrant,
yet it is certainly true, (as a farther confirmation of this,
and for the consolation of those, who may be a little
piqued at what has been said) that painters of every
condition are stronger instances of the almost unavoidable
power of prejudice, than any people whatever.</p>

<p>What are all the <i>manners</i>, as they are call'd, of even
the greatest masters, which are known to differ so
much from one another, and all of them from nature,
but so many strong proofs of their inviolable attachment
to falshood, converted into establish'd truth in their
own eyes, by self-opinion? Rubens would, in all probability,
have been as much disgusted at the dry manner
of Poussin, as Poussin was at the extravagant of Rubens.
The prejudices of inferior proficients in favour of the
imperfections of their own performances, is still more
amazing.&mdash;&mdash;Their eyes are so quick in discerning
the faults of others, at the same time they are so totally
blind to their own! Indeed it would be well for
us all, if one of Gulliver's flappers could be placed at
our elbows to remind us at every stroke how much prejudice
and self-opinion perverts our sight.</p>

<p>From what has been said, I hope it appears that those,
who have no bias of any kind, either from their own
practice, or the lessons of others, are fittest to examine
into the truth of the principles laid down in the following
pages. But as every one may not have had an
opportunity of being sufficiently acquainted with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
instances, that have been given: I will offer one of a
familiar kind, which may be a hint for their observing
a thousand more. How gradually does the eye grow
reconciled even to a disagreeable dress, as it becomes
more and more the fashion, and how soon return to its
dislike of it, when it is left off, and a new one has
taken possession of the mind?&mdash;so vague is taste, when
it has no solid principles for its foundation!</p>

<p>Notwithstanding I have told you my design of
considering minutely the variety of lines, which serve to
raise the ideas of bodies in the mind, and which are
undoubtedly to be consider'd as drawn on the surfaces
only of solid or opake bodies: yet the endeavouring
to conceive, as accurate an idea as is possible,
of the <i>inside</i> of those surfaces, if I may be allow'd the
expression, will be a great assistance to us in the pursuance
of our present enquiry.</p>

<p>In order to my being well understood, let every object
under our consideration, be imagined to have its inward
contents scoop'd out so nicely, as to have nothing
of it left but a thin shell, exactly corresponding both in
its inner and outer surface, to the shape of the object
itself: and let us likewise suppose this thin shell to be
made up of very fine threads, closely connected together,
and equally perceptible, whether the eye is supposed
to observe them from without, or within; and
we shall find the ideas of the two surfaces of this shell
will naturally coincide. The very word, shell, makes
us seem to see both surfaces alike.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of this conceit, as it may be call'd by
some, will be seen to be very great, in the process of this
work: and the oftner we think of objects in this shell-like
manner, we shall facilitate and strengthen our conception
of any particular part of the surface of an object we are viewing,
by acquiring thereby a more perfect
knowledge of the whole, to which it belongs: because
the imagination will naturally enter into the vacant
space within this shell, and there at once, as from a
center, view the whole form within, and mark the opposite
corresponding parts so strongly, as to retain the
idea of the whole, and make us masters of the meaning
of every view of the object, as we walk round it,
and view it from without.</p>

<p>Thus the most perfect idea we can possibly acquire of
a sphere, is by conceiving an infinite number of straight
rays of equal lengths, issuing from the center, as from
the eye, spreading every way alike; and circumscribed
or wound about at their other extremities with close
connected circular threads, or lines, forming a true
spherical shell.</p>

<p>But in the common way of taking the view of any
opake object, that part of its surface, which fronts the
eye, is apt to occupy the mind alone, and the opposite,
nay even every other part of it whatever, is left unthought
of at that time: and the least motion we make
to reconnoitre any other side of the object, confounds
our first idea, for want of the connexion of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
ideas, which the complete knowledge of the whole
would naturally have given us, if we had considered it
in the other way before.</p>

<p>Another advantage of considering objects thus merely
as shells composed of lines, is, that by these means we
obtain the true and full idea of what is call'd the <i>out-lines</i>
of a figure, which has been confin'd within too
narrow limits, by taking it only from drawings on paper;
for in the example of the sphere given above, every
one of the imaginary circular threads has a right to be
consider'd as an out-line of the sphere, as well as those
which divide the half, that is seen, from that which is not
seen; and if the eye be supposed to move regularly round
it, these threads will each of them as regularly succeed
one another in the office of out-lines, (in the narrow
and limited sense of the word:) and the instant any one
of these threads, during this motion of the eye, comes
into sight on one side, its opposite thread is lost, and
disappears on the other. He who will thus take the
pains of acquiring perfect ideas of the distances, bearings,
and oppositions of several material points and lines in
the surfaces of even the most irregular figures, will gradually
arrive at the knack of recalling them into his
mind when the objects themselves are not before him:
and they will be as strong and perfect as those of the
most plain and regular forms, such as cubes and spheres;
and will be of infinite service to those who invent and
draw from fancy, as well as enable those to be more
correct who draw from the life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>In this manner, therefore, I would desire the reader
to assist his imagination as much as possible, in considering
every object, as if his eye were placed within it.
As straight lines are easily conceiv'd, the difficulty of
following this method in the most simple and regular
forms will be less than may be first imagined; and its
use in the more compounded will be greater: as will be
more fully shewn when we come to speak of composition.</p>

<p>But as [Fig. 2 L p. I] may be of singular use to young designers
in the study of the human form, the most
complex and beautiful of all, in shewing them a mechanical
way of gaining the opposite points in its surface,
which never can be seen in one and the same view;
it will be proper to explain the design of it in this place,
as it may at the same time add some weight to what
has been already said.</p>

<p>It represents the trunk of a figure cast in soft wax,
with one wire pass'd perpendicularly through its center,
another perpendicularly to the first, going in before and
coming out in the middle of the back, and as many
more as may be thought necessary, parallel to and at
equal distances from these, and each other; as is mark'd
by the several dots in the figure.&mdash;Let these wires be
so loose as to be taken out at pleasure, but not before
all the parts of them, which appear out of the wax,
are carefully painted close up to the wax, of a different
colour from those, that lie within it. By these means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the horizontal and perpendicular <i>contents</i> of these parts
of the body (by which I mean the distances of opposite
points in the surface of these parts) through which the
wires have pass'd, may be exactly known and compared
with each other; and the little holes, where the wires
have pierced the wax, remaining on its surface, will
mark out the corresponding opposite points on the external
muscles of the body; as well as assist and guide
us to a readier conception of all the intervening parts.
These points may be mark'd upon a marble figure with
calibers properly used.</p>

<p>The known method, many years made use of, for
the more exactly and expeditiously reducing drawings
from large pictures, for engravings; or for enlarging designs,
for painting cielings and cupolas, (by striking
lines perpendicular to each other, so as to make an equal
number of squares on the paper design'd for the copy, that
hath been first made on the original; by which means,
the situation of every part of the picture is mechanically
seen, and easily transferred) may truly be said to be
somewhat of the same kind with what has been here
proposed, but that one is done upon a flat surface, the
other upon a solid; and that the new scheme differs in
its application, and may be of a much more useful and
extensive nature than the old one.</p>

<p>But it is time now to have done with the introduction:
and I shall proceed to consider the fundamental
principles, which are generally allowed to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
elegance and beauty, when duly blended together, to
compositions of all kinds whatever; and point out to my
readers, the particular force of each, in those compositions
in nature and art, which seem most to <i>please and
entertain the eye</i>, and give that grace and beauty, which
is the subject of this enquiry. The principles I mean,
are <span class="smcap">fitness, variety, uniformity, simplicity,
intricacy</span> and <span class="smcap">quantity</span>;&mdash;&mdash;<i>all which co-operate in
the production of beauty, mutually correcting and restraining
each other occasionally</i>.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">fitness</span></i>.</h3>


<p>Fitness of the parts to the design for which
every individual thing is form'd, either by art or
nature, is first to be consider'd, as it is of the
greatest consequence to the beauty of the whole. This
is so evident, that even the sense of seeing, the great
inlet of beauty, is itself so strongly bias'd by it, that if
the mind, on account of this kind of value in a form,
esteem it beautiful, tho' on all other considerations it be
not so; the eye grows insensible of its want of beauty,
and even begins to be pleas'd, especially after it has been
a considerable time acquainted with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well known on the other hand, that forms of
great elegance often disgust the eye by being improperly
applied. Thus, twisted columns are undoubtedly ornamental;
but as they convey an idea of weakness, they
always displease, when they are improperly made use of
as supports to any thing that is bulky, or appears
heavy.</p>

<p>The bulks and proportions of objects are govern'd by
fitness and propriety. It is this that has establish'd the
size and proportion of chairs, tables, and all sorts of
utensils and furniture. It is this that has fix'd the dimensions
of pillars, arches, &amp;c. for the support of great weight, and
so regulated all the orders in architecture,
as well as the sizes of windows and doors, &amp;c. Thus
though a building were ever so large, the steps of the
stairs, the seats in the windows must be continued of their
usual heights, or they would lose their beauty with their
fitness: and in ship-building the dimensions of every
part are confin'd and regulated by fitness for sailing.
When a vessel sails well, the sailors always call her a
beauty; the two ideas have such a connexion!</p>

<p>The general dimensions of the parts of the human
body are adapted thus to the uses they are design'd for.
The trunk is the most capacious on account of the
quantity of its contents, and the thigh is larger than the
leg, because it has both the leg and foot to move, the
leg only the foot, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>Fitness of parts also constitutes and distinguishes in a
great measure the characteristics of objects; as for example,
the race-horse differs as much in quality, or character,
from the war-horse, as to its figure, as the Hercules
from the Mercury.</p>

<p>The race-horse, having all its parts of such dimensions
as best fit the purposes of speed, acquires on that
account a consistent character of one sort of beauty.
To illustrate this, suppose the beautiful head and gracefully-turn'd
neck of the war-horse were placed on the
shoulders of the race-horse, instead of his own aukward
straight one: it would disgust, and deform, instead of
adding beauty; because the judgment would condemn
it as unfit.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 320px;">
<img src="images/3.jpg" width="320" height="471" alt="3" />
</div>

<p>The Hercules, by Glicon [Fig. 3 p. I], hath all its parts finely
fitted for the purposes of the utmost strength, the texture
of the human form will bear. The back, breast
and shoulders have huge bones, and muscles adequate
to the supposed active strength of its upper parts; but
as less strength was required for the lower parts, the judicious
sculptor, contrary to all modern rule of enlarging
every part in proportion, lessen'd the size of the
muscles gradually down towards the feet; and for the
same reason made the neck larger in circumference than
any part of the head [Fig. 4 p. I]; otherwise the figure would have
been burden'd with an unnecessary weight, which would
have been a draw-back from his strength, and in
consequence of that, from its characteristic beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/4.jpg" width="439" height="334" alt="4" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>These seeming faults, which shew the superior anatomical
knowledge as well as judgment of the ancients,
are not to be found in the leaden imitations of it near
Hyde-park. These saturnine genius's imagin'd they
knew how to correct such apparent <i>disproportions</i>.</p>

<p>These few examples may be sufficient to give an idea
of what I mean (and would have understood)
by the beauty of fitness, or propriety.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Variety</span></i>.</h3>


<p>How great a share variety has in producing beauty
may be seen in the ornamental part of nature.</p>

<p>The shapes and colours of plants, flowers, leaves, the
paintings in butterflies wings, shells, &amp;c. seem of little
other intended use, than that of entertaining the eye
with the pleasure of variety.</p>

<p>All the senses delight in it, and equally are averse to
sameness. The ear is as much offended with one even
continued note, as the eye is with being fix'd to a point,
or to the view of a dead wall.</p>

<p>Yet when the eye is glutted with a succession of variety,
it finds relief in a certain degree of sameness; and
even plain space becomes agreeable, and properly introduced,
and contrasted with variety, adds to it more
variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>I mean here, and every where indeed, a composed
variety; for variety uncomposed, and without design,
is confusion and deformity.</p>

<p>Observe, that a gradual lessening is a kind of varying
that gives beauty. The pyramid diminishing from its
basis to its point, and the scroll or voluta, gradually
lessening to its center, are beautiful forms. So also objects
that only seem to do so, though in fact they do
not, have equal beauty: thus perspective views, and
particularly those of buildings, are always pleasing to
the eye.</p>

<p>The little ship, between figure 47 and 88 [p. I], suppos'd
moving along the shore even with the eye, might have
its top and bottom bounded by two lines at equal distances
all the way, as A; but if the ship puts out to
sea, these lines at top and bottom would seem to vary
and meet each other by degrees, as B, in the point C,
which is in the line where the sky and water meets,
call'd the horizon. Thus much of the manner of perspectives
adding beauty, by seemingly varying otherwise
unvaried forms, I thought, might be acceptable
to those, who have not learnt perspective.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Uniformity, Regularity,</span> or <span class="smcap">Symmetry</span></i>.</h3>


<p>It may be imagined that the greatest part of the effects
of beauty results from the symmetry of parts
in the object, which is beautiful: but I am very well
persuaded, this prevailing notion will soon appear to
have little or no foundation.</p>

<p>It may indeed have properties of greater consequence,
such as propriety, fitness, and use; and yet but little
serve the purposes of pleasing the eye, merely on the
score of beauty.</p>

<p>We have, indeed, in our nature a love of imitation
from our infancy, and the eye is often entertained, as
well as surprised, with mimicry, and delighted with
the exactness of counterparts: but then this always
gives way to its superior love of variety, and soon grows
tiresom.</p>

<p>If the uniformity of figures, parts, or lines were truly
the chief cause of beauty, the more exactly uniform
their appearances were kept, the more pleasure the eye
would receive: but this is so far from being the case,
that when the mind has been once satisfied, that the
parts answer one another, with so exact an uniformity,
as to preserve to the whole the character of fitness to
stand, to move, to sink, to swim, to fly, &amp;c. without
losing the balance: the eye is rejoiced to see the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
turn'd, and shifted, so as to vary these uniform appearances.</p>

<p>Thus the profile of most objects, as well as faces,
are rather more pleasing than their full fronts.</p>

<p>Whence it is clear, the pleasure does not arise from
seeing the exact resemblance, which one side bears the
other, but from the knowledge that they do so on account
of fitness, with design, and for use. For when
the head of a fine woman is turn'd a little to one side,
which takes off from the exact similarity of the two halves
of the face, and somewhat reclining, so varying still
more from the straight and parallel lines of a formal
front face: it is always look'd upon as most pleasing.
This is accordingly said to be a graceful air of the
head.</p>

<p>It is a constant rule in composition in painting to
avoid regularity. When we view a building, or any
other object in life, we have it in our power, by shifting
the ground, to take that view of it which pleases
us best; and in consequence of this, the painter if he is
left to his choice, takes it on the angle rather than in
front, as most agreeable to the eye; because the regularity
of the lines is taken away by their running into
perspective, without losing the idea of fitness: and
when he is of necessity obliged to give the front of a
building, with all its equalities and parallelisms, he generally
breaks (as it is term'd) such disagreeable appearances,
by throwing a tree before it, or the shadow of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
imaginary cloud, or some other object that may answer
the same purpose of adding variety, which is the same
with taking away uniformity.</p>

<p>If uniform objects were agreeable, why is there such
care taken to contrast, and vary all the limbs of a statue?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/72-7-6.jpg" width="400" height="302" alt="figs 72 , 7 and 6" />
</div>

<p>The picture of Henry the Eighth [Fig. 72 p. II], would be preferable
to the finely contrasted figures of Guido or Correggio;
and the Antinous's easy sway [Fig. 6 p. I], must submit to
the stiff and straight figure of the dancing-master [Fig. 7 p. I];
and the uniform out-lines of the muscles in the figure [Fig. 55 p. I]
taken from Albert Durer's book of proportions, would
have more taste in them than those in the famous part
of an antique figure [Fig. 54 p. I] from which Michael Angelo acquired
so much of his skill in grace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 539px;">
<img src="images/55-54.jpg" width="539" height="216" alt="figs 55 and 54" />
</div>

<p>In short, whatever appears to be fit, and proper to answer
great purposes, ever satisfies the mind, and pleases
on that account. Uniformity is of this kind. We find it
necessary, in some degree, to give the idea of rest and
motion, without the possibility of falling. But when any
such purposes can be as well effected by more irregular
parts, the eye is always better pleased on the account of
variety.</p>

<p>How pleasingly is the idea of firmness in standing
convey'd to the eye by the three elegant claws of a table,
the three feet of a tea-lamp, or the celebrated tripod of
the ancients?</p>

<p>Thus you see regularity, uniformity, or symmetry,
please only as they serve to give the idea of fitness.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Simplicity,</span> or <span class="smcap">Distinctness</span></i>.</h3>


<p>Simplicity, without variety, is wholly insipid, and at
best does only not displease; but when variety is
join'd to it, then it pleases, because it enhances
the pleasure of variety, by giving the eye the power of enjoying
it with ease.</p>

<p>There is no object composed of straight lines, that
has so much variety, with so few parts, as the pyramid:
and it is its constantly varying from its base gradually upwards
in every situation of the eye, (without giving the
idea of sameness, as the eye moves round it) that has
made it been esteem'd in all ages, in preference to the
cone, which in all views appears nearly the same, being
varied only by light and shade.</p>

<p>Steeples, monuments, and most compositions in painting
and sculpture, are kept within the form of the cone
or pyramid, as the most eligible boundary on account
of their simplicity and variety. For the same reason
equestrian statues please more than the single figures.</p>

<p>The authors (for there were three concern'd in the
work) of as fine a group of figures in sculpture, as ever
was made, either by ancients or moderns, (I mean Laocoon
and his two sons) chose to be guilty of the absurdity
of making the sons of half the father's size, tho'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
they have every other mark of being design'd for men,
rather than not bring their composition within the
boundary of a pyramid [Fig. 9 T p. I]. Thus if a judicious workman
were employ'd to make a case of wood, for preserving
it from the injuries of the weather, or for the
convenience of carriage; he would soon find by his eye,
the whole composition would readily fit and be easily
pack'd up, in one of a pyramidal form.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 258px;">
<img src="images/9.jpg" width="258" height="360" alt="9" />
</div>

<p>Steeples, &amp;c. have generally been varied from the
cone, to take off from their too great simplicity, and instead
of their circular bases, polygons of different, but
even numbers of sides, have been substituted, I suppose
for the sake of uniformity. These forms however may be
said to have been chosen by the architect, with a view
to the cone, as the whole compositions might be bounded
by it.</p>

<p>Yet, in my mind, odd numbers have the advantage
over the even ones, as variety is more pleasing than uniformity,
where the same end is answer'd by both; as in
this case, where both polygons may be circumscrib'd by
the same circle, or in other words, both compositions
bounded by the same cone.</p>

<p>And I can't help observing, that nature in all her
works of fancy, if I may be allow'd the expression,
where it seems immaterial whether even or odd numbers
of divisions were prefer'd, most frequently employs the
odd; as for example, in the indenting of leaves, flowers,
blossoms, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>The oval also, on account of its variety with simplicity,
is as much to be prefer'd to the circle, as the
triangle to the square, or the pyramid to the cube; and
this figure lessen'd at one end, like the egg, thereby
being more varied, is singled out by the author of all
variety, to bound the features of a beautiful face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 151px;">
<img src="images/10.jpg" width="151" height="148" alt="10" />
<div class="caption">10</div>
</div>

<p>When the oval has a little more of the cone added
to it than the egg has, it becomes more distinctly a
compound of those two most simple varied figures.
This is the shape of the pine-apple [Fig. 10 T p. I], which nature has
particularly distinguish'd by bestowing ornaments of
rich mosaic upon it, composed of contrasted serpentine
lines, and the pips [Fig. 11 T p. I], as the gardiners call them, are still
varied by two cavities and one round eminence in each.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 162px;">
<img src="images/11.jpg" width="162" height="155" alt="11" />
<div class="caption">11</div>
</div>

<p>Could a more elegant simple form than this have
been found; it is probable that judicious architect, Sir
Christopher Wren, would not have chosen the pine-apples
for the two terminations of the sides of the front
of St. Paul's: and perhaps the globe and cross, tho' a
finely varied figure, which terminates the dome, would
not have had the preference of situation, if a religious
motive had not been the occasion.</p>

<p>Thus we see simplicity gives beauty even to variety,
as it makes it more easily understood, and should be ever
studied in the works of art, as it serves to prevent perplexity
in forms of elegance; as will be shewn in the
next chapter.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Intricacy</span></i>.</h3>


<p>The active mind is ever bent to be employ'd. Pursuing
is the business of our lives; and even abstracted
from any other view, gives pleasure. Every
arising difficulty, that for a while attends and interrupts
the pursuit, gives a sort of spring to the mind, enhances
the pleasure, and makes what would else be toil and
labour, become sport and recreation.</p>

<p>Wherein would consist the joys of hunting, shooting,
fishing, and many other favourite diversions, without
the frequent turns and difficulties, and disappointments,
that are daily met with in the pursuit?&mdash;how joyless
does the sportsman return when the hare has not had
fair play? how lively, and in spirits, even when an old
cunning one has baffled, and out-run the dogs!</p>

<p>This love of pursuit, merely as pursuit, is implanted
in our natures, and design'd, no doubt, for necessary,
and useful purposes. Animals have it evidently by instinct.
The hound dislikes the game he so eagerly pursues;
and even cats will risk the losing of their prey to
chase it over again. It is a pleasing labour of the mind
to solve the most difficult problems; allegories and
riddles, trifling as they are, afford the mind amusement:
and with what delight does it follow the well-connected
thread of a play, or novel, which ever increases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
as the plot thickens, and ends most pleas'd,
when that is most distinctly unravell'd?</p>

<p>The eye hath this sort of enjoyment in winding
walks, and serpentine rivers, and all sorts of objects,
whose forms, as we shall see hereafter, are composed
principally of what, I call, the <i>waving</i> and <i>serpentine</i>
lines.</p>

<p>Intricacy in form, therefore, I shall define to be that
peculiarity in the lines, which compose it, that <i>leads
the eye a wanton kind of chace</i>, and from the pleasure
that gives the mind, intitles it to the name of beautiful:
and it may be justly said, that the cause of the idea
of grace more immediately resides in this principle,
than in the other five, except variety; which indeed
includes this, and all the others.</p>

<p>That this observation may appear to have a real
foundation in nature, every help will be requir'd, which
the reader himself can call to his assistance, as well as
what will here be suggested to him.</p>

<p>To set this matter in somewhat a clearer light, the
familiar instance of a common jack, with a circular fly,
may serve our purpose better than a more elegant form:
preparatory to which, let the figure [Fig. 14 T p. I] be consider'd,
which represents the eye, at a common reading distance
viewing a row of letters, but fix'd with most attention to
the middle letter A.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 245px;">
<img src="images/14.jpg" width="245" height="235" alt="14" />
</div>

<p>Now as we read, a ray may be supposed to be drawn
from the center of the eye to that letter it looks at first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and to move successively with it from letter to letter,
the whole length of the line: but if the eye stops at
any particular letter, A, to observe it more than the
rest, these other letters will grow more and more imperfect
to the sight, the farther they are situated on
either side of A, as is express'd in the figure: and
when we endeavour to see all the letters in a line equally
perfect at one view, as it were, this imaginary ray must
course it to and fro with great celerity. Thus though
the eye, strictly speaking, can only pay due attention to
these letters in succession, yet the amazing ease and
swiftness, with which it performs this task, enables us
to see considerable spaces with sufficient satisfaction at
one sudden view.</p>

<p>Hence, we shall always suppose some such principal
ray moving along with the eye, and tracing out the
parts of every form, we mean to examine in the most
perfect manner: and when we would follow with exactness
the course any body takes, that is in motion,
this ray is always to be supposed to move with the
body.</p>

<p>In this manner of attending to forms, they will be
found, whether <i>at rest</i>, or <i>in motion</i>, to give <i>movement</i>
to this imaginary ray; or, more properly speaking, to
the eye itself, affecting it <i>thereby</i> more or less <i>pleasingly</i>,
according to their different <i>shapes</i> and <i>motions</i>. Thus,
for example, in the instance of the jack, whether the
eye (with this imaginary ray) moves slowly down the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
line, to which the weight is fix'd, or attends to the slow
motion of the weight itself, the mind is equally fatigu'd:
and whether it swiftly courses round the circular
rim of the flyer, when the jack stands; or nimbly
follows one point in its circularity whilst it is whirling
about, we are almost equally made giddy by it.
But our sensation differs much from either of these unpleasant
ones, when we observe the curling worm, into
which the worm-wheel is fixt [Fig. 15 L p. I]: for this is always
pleasing, either at rest or in motion, and whether that
motion is slow or quick.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 236px;">
<img src="images/15.jpg" width="236" height="234" alt="" />
</div>

<p>That it is accounted so, when it is <i>at rest</i>, appears by
the ribbon, twisted round a stick (represented on one
side of this figure) which has been a long-establish'd
ornament in the carvings of frames, chimney-pieces,
and door-cases; and call'd by the carvers, <i>the stick and
ribbon ornament</i>: and when the stick, through the
middle is omitted, it is call'd the <i>ribbon edge</i>; both to
be seen in almost every house of fashion.</p>

<p>But the pleasure it gives the eye is still more lively
when <i>in motion</i>. I never can forget my frequent strong
attention to it, when I was very young, and that its beguiling
movement gave me the same kind of sensation
then, which I since have felt at seeing a country-dance;
tho' perhaps the latter might be somewhat more engaging;
particularly when my eye eagerly pursued a
favourite dancer, through all the windings of the figure,
who then was bewitching to the sight, as the imaginary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
ray, we were speaking of, was dancing with her all
the time.</p>

<p>This single example might be sufficient to explain
what I mean by <i>the beauty of a composed intricacy of
form</i>; and how it may be said, with propriety, to <i>lead</i>
the eye a <i>kind of chace</i>.</p>

<p>But the hair of the head is another very obvious instance,
which, being design'd chiefly as an ornament,
proves more or less so, according to the form it naturally
takes, or is put into by art. The most amiable in
itself is the flowing curl; and the many waving and
contrasted turns of naturally intermingling locks ravish
the eye with the pleasure of the pursuit, especially
when they are put in motion by a gentle breeze.
The poet knows it, as well as the painter, and has described
the wanton ringlets waving in the wind.</p>

<p>And yet to shew how excess ought to be avoided in
intricacy, as well as in every other principle, the very
same head of hair, wisp'd, and matted together, would
make the most disagreeable figure; because the eye
would be perplex'd, and at a fault, and unable to trace
such a confused number of uncomposed and entangled
lines; and yet notwithstanding this, the present fashion
the ladies have gone into, of wearing a part of the hair
of their heads braided together from behind, like intertwisted
serpents, arising thickest from the bottom, lessening
as it is brought forward, and naturally conforming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to the shape of the rest of the hair it is pin'd
over, is extremely picturesque. Their thus interlacing
the hair in distinct varied quantities is an artful way of
preserving as much of intricacy, as is beautiful.</p>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Quantity</span></i>.</h3>


<p>Forms of magnitude, although ill-shaped, will
however, on account of their vastness, draw our
attention and raise our admiration.</p>

<p>Huge shapeless rocks have a pleasing kind of horror
in them, and the wide ocean awes us with its vast
contents; but when forms of beauty are presented to
the eye in large quantities, the pleasure
increases on the mind, and horror is soften'd
into reverence.</p>

<p>How solemn and pleasing are groves of high grown
trees, great churches, and palaces? has not even a single
spreading oak, grown to maturity, acquir'd the character
of the venerable oak?</p>

<p>Windsor castle is a noble instance of the effect of
quantity. The hugeness of its few distinct parts strikes
the eye with uncommon grandeur at a distance, as well
as nigh. It is quantity, with simplicity, which makes
it one of the finest objects in the kingdom, tho' void
of any regular order of architecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>The Façade of the old Louvre at Paris is also remarkable
for its quantity. This fragment is allow'd to
be the finest piece of building in France, tho' there are
many equal, if not superior, to it in all other respects,
except that of quantity.</p>

<p>Who does not feel a pleasure when he pictures in his
mind the immense buildings which once adorn'd the
lower Egypt, by imagining the whole complete, and
ornamented with colossal statues?</p>

<p>Elephants and whales please us with their unwieldy
greatness. Even large personages, merely for being so,
command respect: nay, quantity is an addition to the
person which often supplies a deficiency in his figure.</p>

<p>The robes of state are always made large and full,
because they give a grandeur of appearance, suitable to
the offices of the greatest distinction. The judge's robes
have an awful dignity given them by the quantity of
their contents, and when the train is held up, there is
a noble waving line descending from the shoulders of
the judge to the hand of his train-bearer. So when the
train is gently thrown aside, it generally falls into a great
variety of folds, which again employ the eye, and fix
its attention.</p>

<p>The grandeur of the Eastern dress, which so far surpasses
the European, depends as much on quantity as on
costliness.</p>

<p>In a word, it is quantity which adds greatness to grace.
But then excess is to be avoided, or quantity will become
clumsy, heavy, or ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 316px;">
<img src="images/16.jpg" width="316" height="503" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The full-bottom wig, like the lion's mane, hath
something noble in it, and adds not only dignity, but
sagacity to the countenance [fig. 16 p. I]: but were it to be worn
as large again, it would become a burlesque; or were
an improper person to put it on, it would then too be
ridiculous.</p>


<p>When improper, or <i>incompatible</i> excesses meet, they
always excite laughter; more especially when the forms
of those excesses are inelegant, that is, when they are
composed of unvaried lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/17-18.jpg" width="192" height="290" alt="17 and 18" />
</div>

<p>For example, the figure refer'd to in the margin [Fig. 17 p. I],
represents a fat grown face of a man, with an infant's
cap on, and the rest of the child's dress stuff'd, and so
well placed under his chin, as to seem to belong to that
face. This is a contrivance I have seen at Bartholomew-fair,
and always occasion'd a roar of laughter. The
next [Fig. 18 p. I] is of the same kind, a child with a man's wig
and cap on. In these you see the ideas of youth and
age jumbled together, in forms without beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 326px;">
<img src="images/19.jpg" width="326" height="504" alt="19" />
</div>

<p>So a Roman general [Fig. 19 p. I], dress'd by a modern tailor and
peruke-maker, for tragedy, is a comic figure.&mdash;&mdash;The
dresses of the times are mix'd, and the lines which compose
them are straight or only round.</p>

<p>Dancing-masters, representing deities, in their grand
ballets on the stage, are no less ridiculous. See the
Jupiter [Fig. 20 p. I].</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 241px;">
<img src="images/20.jpg" width="241" height="147" alt="20" />
</div>

<p>Nevertheless custom and fashion will, in length of
time, reconcile almost every absurdity whatever, to the
eye, or make it over-look'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>It is from the same joining of opposite ideas that
makes us laugh at the owl and the ass, for under their
aukward forms, they seem to be gravely musing and
meditating, as if they had the sense of human beings.</p>

<p>A monkey too whose figure, as well as most of his
actions, so odly resembles the human, is also very comical;
and he becomes more so when a coat is put on
him, as he then becomes a greater burlesque on the
man.</p>

<p>There is something extremely odd and comical in
the rough shock dog. The ideas here connected are
the inelegant and inanimate figure of a thrum mop, or
muff, and that of a sensible, friendly animal; which
is as much a burlesque of the dog, as the monkey when
his coat is on, is of the man.</p>

<p>What can it be but this inelegance of the figure,
join'd with impropriety, that makes a whole audience
burst into laughter, when they see the miller's sack, in
Dr. Faustus, jumping across the stage? was a well-shap'd
vase to do the same, it would equally surprise, but not
make every body laugh, because the elegance of the
form would prevent it.</p>

<p>For when the forms, thus join'd together, are each
of them elegant, and composed of agreeable lines, they
will be so far from making us laugh, that they will become
entertaining to the imagination, as well as pleasing
to the eye. The sphinx and siren have been admired
and accounted ornamental in all ages. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
former represents strength and beauty join'd; the
latter, beauty and swiftness, in pleasing and graceful
forms.</p>

<p>The griffin, a modern hieroglyphic, signifying strength
and swiftness, united in the two noble forms of the lion
and eagle, is a grand object. So the antique centaur
hath a savage greatness as well as beauty.</p>

<p>These may be said to be monsters, it's true, but then
they convey such noble ideas, and have such elegance
in their forms as greatly compensates for their being unnaturally
join'd together.</p>

<p>I shall mention but one more instance of this sort,
and that the most extraordinary of all, which is an infant's
head of about two years old, with a pair of duck's-wings
placed under its chin, supposed always to be flying
about, and singing psalms [Fig. 22 R p. I].</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/22.jpg" width="233" height="202" alt="22" />
</div>

<p>A painter's representation of heaven would be nothing
without swarms of these little inconsistent objects, flying
about, or perching on the clouds; and yet there is something
so agreeable in their form, that the eye is reconciled
and overlooks the absurdity, and we find them in
the carving and painting of almost every church. St.
Paul's is full of them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As the foregoing principles are the very ground work
of what is to follow; we will, in order to make them
the more familiar to us, just speak of them in the way
they are daily put in practice, and may be seen, in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
dress that is worn; and we shall find not only that ladies
of fashion, but that women of every rank, who are said
to dress prettily, have known their force, without considering
them as principles.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>I. Fitness is first considered by them, as knowing that
their dresses should be useful, commodious, and fitted to
their different ages; or rich, airy, and loose, agreeable
to the character they would give out to the public by their
dress.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>II. Uniformity is chiefly complied with in dress on
account of fitness, and seems to be extended not much
farther than dressing both arms alike, and having the
shoes of the same colour. For when any part of dress
has not the excuse of fitness or propriety for its uniformity
of parts, the ladies always call it <i>formal</i>.</p>

<p>For which reason, when they are at liberty to make
what shapes they please in ornamenting their persons,
those of the best taste choose the irregular as the more
engaging: for example, no two patches are ever chosen
of the same size, or placed at the same height; nor a
single one in the middle of a feature, unless it be to hide
a blemish. So a single feather, flower, or jewel is generally
placed on one side of the head; or if ever put in
front, it is turn'd awry to avoid formality.</p>

<p>It was once the fashion to have two curls of equal size,
stuck at the same height close upon the forehead, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
probably took its rise from seeing the pretty effect of
curls falling loosely over the face.</p>

<p>A lock of hair falling thus cross the temples, and by
that means breaking the regularity of the oval, has an
effect too alluring to be strictly decent, as is very well
known to the loose and lowest class of women: but being
pair'd in so stiff a manner, as they formerly were,
they lost the desired effect, and ill deserv'd the name of
favourites.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>III. Variety in dress, both as to colour and form, is
the constant study of the young and gay&mdash;&mdash;But then,</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>IV. That taudriness may not destroy the proper
effect of variety, simplicity is call'd in to restrain its
superfluities, and is often very artfully made use of
to set native beauty off to more advantage. I have
not known any set of people, that have more excell'd
in this principle of simplicity, or plainness, than the
Quakers.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>V. Quantity, or fulness in dress has ever been a darling
principle; so that sometimes those parts of dress, which
would properly admit of being extended to a great degree,
have been carried into such strange excesses, that in
the reign of Queen Elizabeth a law was made to put a
stop to the growth of ruffs: nor is the enormous size of
the hoops at present, a less sufficient proof of the extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
love of quantity in dress, beyond that of convenience
or elegance.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>VI. The beauty of intricacy lies in contriving winding
shapes, such as the antique lappets belonging to the
head of the sphinx [Fig. 21 p. I], or as the modern lappet when it is
brought before. Every part of dress, that will admit
of the application of this principle, has an air (as it is
term'd) given to it thereby; and altho' it requires dexterity
and a taste to execute these windings well, we find
them daily practised with success.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/21.jpg" width="406" height="312" alt="21" />
</div>

<p>This principle also recommends modesty in dress, to
keep up our expectations, and not suffer them to be too
soon gratified. Therefore the body and limbs should
all be cover'd, and little more than certain hints be
given of them thro' the cloathing.</p>

<p>The face indeed will bear a constant view, yet always
entertain and keep our curiosity awake, without the
assistance either of a mask, or veil; because vast variety
of changing circumstances keeps the eye and the mind
in constant play, in following the numberless turns of
expression it is capable of. How soon does a face that
wants expression grow insipid, tho' it be ever so pretty?&mdash;The
rest of the body, not having these advantages in
common with the face, would soon satiate the eye, were
it to be as constantly exposed, nor would it have more
effect than a marble statue. But when it is artfully
cloath'd and decorated, the mind at every turn resumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
its imaginary pursuits concerning it. Thus, if I may
be allow'd a simile, the angler chooses not to see the fish
he angles for, until it is fairly caught.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Lines</span></i>.</h3>


<p>It may be remember'd that in the introduction, the
reader is desired to consider the surfaces of objects
as so many shells of lines, closely connected together,
which idea of them it will now be proper to call to
mind, for the better comprehending not only this, but
all the following chapters on composition.</p>

<p>The constant use made of lines by mathematicians,
as well as painters, in describing things upon paper, hath
establish'd a conception of them, as if actually existing
on the real forms themselves. This likewise we suppose,
and shall set out with saying in general&mdash;That <i>the straight
line</i>, and <i>the circular line</i>, together with their different
combinations, and variations, &amp;c. bound, and circumscribe
all visible objects whatsoever, thereby producing
such endless variety of forms, as lays us under the necessity
of dividing, and distinguishing them into general
classes; leaving the intervening mixtures of appearances
to the reader's own farther observation.</p>

<p>First, [Fig. 23 T p. I] objects composed of straight lines only, as the cube,
or of circular lines, as the sphere, or of both together,
as cylinders and cones, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 204px;">
<img src="images/23.jpg" width="204" height="157" alt="23" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, [Fig. 24 T p. I] those composed of straight lines, circular
lines, and of lines partly straight, and partly circular, as
the capitals of columns, and vases, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">
<img src="images/24.jpg" width="272" height="155" alt="24" />
</div>

<p>Thirdly, [Fig. 25 T p. I] those composed of all the former together
with an addition of the waving line, which is a line
more productive of beauty than any of the former, as in
flowers, and other forms of the ornamental kind: for
which reason we shall call it the line of beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/25.jpg" width="323" height="157" alt="25" />
</div>

<p>Fourthly, [Fig. 26 T p. I] those composed of all the former together
with the serpentine line, as the human form, which
line hath the power of super-adding grace to beauty.
Note, forms of most grace have least of the straight line
in them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;">
<img src="images/26.jpg" width="505" height="154" alt="26" />
</div>

<p>It is to be observed, that straight lines vary only in
length, and therefore are least ornamental.</p>

<p>That curved lines as they can be varied in their degrees
of curvature as well as in their lengths, begin on
that account to be ornamental.</p>

<p>That straight and curv'd lines join'd, being a compound
line, vary more than curves alone, and so become
somewhat more ornamental.</p>

<p>That the waving line, or line of beauty, varying still
more, being composed of two curves contrasted, becomes
still more ornamental and pleasing, insomuch
that the hand takes a lively movement in making it
with pen or pencil.</p>

<p>And that the serpentine line, by its waving and winding
at the same time different ways, leads the eye in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
pleasing manner along the continuity of its variety, if I
may be allowed the expression; and which by its twisting
so many different ways, may be said to inclose (tho'
but a single line) varied contents; and therefore all its
variety cannot be express'd on paper by one continued
line, without the assistance of the imagination, or the
help of a figure; see [Fig. 26 T p. I] where that sort of proportion'd,
winding line, which will hereafter be call'd the precise
serpentine line, or <i>line of grace</i>, is represented by a fine
wire, properly twisted round the elegant and varied
figure of a cone.</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of what sort of <span class="smcap">Parts,</span> and how <span class="smcap">pleasing Forms</span> are
composed</i>.</h3>


<p>Thus far having endeavoured to open as large an
idea as possible of the power of variety, by having
partly shewn that those lines which have most variety
in themselves, contribute most towards the production
of beauty; we will next shew how lines may be put
together, so as to make pleasing figures or compositions.</p>

<p>In order to be as clear as possible, we will give a few
examples of the most familiar and easy sort, and let
them serve as a clue to be pursued in the imagination:
I say in the imagination chiefly, for the following method
is not meant always to be put in practice, or follow'd
in every case, for indeed that could hardly be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and in some it would be ridiculously losing time if it
could&mdash;&mdash;Yet there may be cases where it may be necessary
to follow this method minutely; as for example,
in architecture.</p>

<p>I am thoroughly convinc'd in myself, however it may
startle some, that a completely new and harmonious
order of architecture in all its parts, might be produced
by the following method of composing, but hardly with
certainty without it; and this I am the more apt to believe,
as upon the strictest examination, those four orders
of the ancients, which are so well established for beauty
and true proportion, perfectly agree with the scheme we
shall now lay down.</p>

<p>This way of composing pleasing forms, is to be accomplished
by making choice of variety of lines, as to
their shapes and dimensions; and then again by varying
their situations with each other, by all the different ways
that can be conceived: and at the same time (if a solid
figure be the subject of the composition) the contents or
space that is to be inclosed within those lines, must be
duly consider'd and vary'd too, as much as possible,
with propriety. In a word, it may be said, the art of
composing well is the art of varying well. It is not
expected that this should at first be perfectly comprehended,
yet I believe it will be made sufficiently clear
by the help of the examples following.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 242px;">
<img src="images/29.jpg" width="242" height="322" alt="29" />
</div>

<p>The figure [Fig. 29 T p. I], represents the simple and pleasing figure
of a bell; this shell, as we may call it, is composed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
waving lines, encompassing, or bounding within it, the varied
space marked with dotted lines: here you see the variety
of the space within is equal to the beauty of its form
without, and if the space, or contents, were to be more
varied, the outward form would have still more beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/30-31-32.jpg" width="500" height="274" alt="figs 30, 31 and 32" />
</div>

<p>As a proof, see a composition of more parts, and a
way by which those parts may be put together by a
certain method of varying: i. e. how the one half of the
socket of the candlestick A [Fig. 30 T p. I], may be varied as the other
half B. Let a convenient and fit height be first given
for a candlestick, as [Fig. 31 T p. I], then let the necessary size of the
socket be determined, as at (a) [Fig. 32] after which, in order
to give it a better form, let every <i>distance</i> or length of
divisions differ from the length of the socket, as also vary
in their distances from each other, as is seen by the
points on the line under the socket (a); that is let any
two points, <i>signifying distance</i>, be plac'd farthest from
any other two near points, observing always that there
should be one distance or part larger than all the rest;
and you will readily see that variety could not be so
complete without it.&mdash;In like manner, let the horizontal
distances (always keeping within the bounds of fitness)
be varied both as to distances and situations, as on the
opposite side of the same figure (b); then unite and join
all the several distances into a complete shell, by applying
several parts of curves and straight lines; varying
them also by making them of different sizes, as (c): and
apply them as at (d) in the same figure, and you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the candlestick [Fig. 33 T p. I], and with still more variations on the
other side. If you divide the candlestick into many more
parts, it will appear crouded, as [Fig. 34 T p. I] it will want distinctness
of form on a near view, and lose the effect of variety
at a distance: this the eye will easily distinguish on
removing pretty far from it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/33-34.jpg" width="400" height="389" alt=" fgs 33 and 34" />
</div>

<p>Simplicity in composition, or distinctness of parts, is
ever to be attended to, as it is one part of beauty, as
has been already said: but that what I mean by distinctness
of parts in this place, may be better understood, it
will be proper to explain it by an example.</p>

<p>When you would compose an object of a great variety
of parts, let several of those parts be distinguish'd by
themselves, by their remarkable difference from the next
adjoining, so as to make each of them, as it were, one
well-shap'd quantity or part, as is marked by the dotted
lines in figure [35 T p. I] (these are like what they call passages
in music, and in writing paragraphs) by which means,
not only the whole, but even every part, will be better
understood by the eye: for confusion will hereby be
avoided when the object is seen near, and the shapes will
seem well varied, tho' fewer in number, at a distance;
as figure [36 p. I] supposed to be the same as the former, but
removed so far off that the eye loses sight of the smaller
members.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;">
<img src="images/35-36.jpg" width="297" height="406" alt="figs 35 and 36" />
</div>

<p>The parsley-leaf [Fig. 37 T p. I], in like manner, from whence a
beautiful foliage in ornament was originally taken, is divided
into three distinct passages; which are again divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
into other odd numbers; and this method is observ'd,
for the generality, in the leaves of all plants and flowers,
the most simple of which are the trefoil and cinquefoil.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 481px;">
<img src="images/37.jpg" width="481" height="415" alt="37" />
</div>

<p>Light and shade, and colours, also must have their
distinctness to make objects completely beautiful: but
of these in their proper places&mdash;&mdash;only I will give you
a general idea of what is here meant by the beauty
of distinctness of forms, lights, shades, and colours, by
putting you in mind of the reverse effects in all them
together.</p>

<p>Observe the well-composed nosegay how it loses all
its distinctness when it dies; each leaf and flower then
shrivels and loses its distinct shape; and the firm colours
fade into a kind of sameness: so that the whole gradually
becomes a confused heap.</p>

<p>If the general parts of objects are preserv'd large at
first, they will always admit of farther enrichments of a
small kind, but then they must be so small as not to
confound the general masses or quantities.&mdash;thus you
see variety is a check upon itself when overdone, which
of course begets what is call'd a <i>petit taste</i> and a confusion
to the eye.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 231px;">
<img src="images/38-39.jpg" width="231" height="431" alt="figs 38 and 39" />
</div>

<p>It will not be amiss next to shew what effects an object
or two will have that are put together without, or
contrary to these rules of composing variety. Figure [38 L p. I],
is taken from one of those branches fixt to the sides of
common old-fashion'd stove-grates by way of ornament,
wherein you see how the parts have been varied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
fancy only, and yet pretty well: close to which [Fig. 39 L p. I]
is another, with about the like number of parts; but as the
shapes, neither are enough varied as to their contents,
nor in their situations with each other, but one shape
follows its exact likeness: it is therefore a disagreeable
and tasteless figure, and for the same reason the candlestick,
fig. [40 T p. I] is still worse, as there is less variety in it.
Nay, it would be better to be quite plain, as figure [41 T p. I],
than with such poor attempts at ornament.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/40-2.jpg" width="350" height="530" alt="figs 40-2" />
</div>

<p>These few examples, well understood, will, I imagine,
be sufficient to put what was said at the beginning of
this chapter out of all doubt, viz. that <i>the art of composing
well</i> is no more than the <i>art of varying well</i>; and
to shew, that the method which has been here explain'd,
must consequently produce a pleasing proportion amongst
the parts; as well as that all deviations from it will produce
the contrary. Yet to strengthen this latter assertion,
let the following figures, taken from the life, be
examin'd by the above rules for composing, and it will
be found that the Indian-fig or torch-thistle, figure [42 T p. I],
as well as all that tribe of uncouth shaped exotics, have the
same reasons for being ugly, as the candlestick, fig. 40;
as also that the beauties of the Lily [Fig. 43 T p. I] and the calcidonian
Iris [Fig. 44 T p. I] proceeds from their being composed with great
variety, and that the loss of variety, to a certain degree,
in the imitations of those flowers underneath them (fig.
45 and 46) is the cause of the meanness of their shapes,
tho' they retain enough to be call'd by the same names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>Hitherto, with regard to composition, little else but
forms made up of straight and curv'd lines have been
spoken of, and though these lines have but little variety
in themselves, yet by reason of the great diversifications
that they are capable of in being join'd with one another;
great variety of beauty of the more useful sort is
produced by them, as in necessary utensils and building:
but in my opinion, buildings as I before hinted, might
be much more varied than they are, for after <i>fitness</i> hath
been strictly and mechanically complied with, any additional
ornamental members, or parts, may, by the foregoing
rules, be varied with equal elegance; nor can I
help thinking, but that churches, palaces, hospitals,
prisons, common houses and summer houses, might be
built more in distinct characters than they are, by contriving
orders suitable to each; whereas were a modern
architect to build a palace in Lapland, or the West-Indies,
Paladio must be his guide, nor would he dare to
stir a step without his book.</p>

<p>Have not many gothic buildings a great deal of consistent
beauty in them? perhaps acquired by a series of
improvements made from time to time by the natural
persuasion of the eye, which often very near answers the
end of working by principles; and sometimes begets
them. There is at present such a thirst after variety, that
even paltry imitations of Chinese buildings have a kind of
vogue, chiefly on account of their novelty: but not
only these, but any other new-invented characters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
building might be regulated by proper principles. The
mere ornaments of buildings, to be sure, at least might
be allow'd a greater latitude than they are at present;
as capitals, frizes, &amp;c. in order to increase the beauty
of variety.</p>

<p>Nature, in shells and flowers, &amp;c. affords an infinite
choice of elegant hints for this purpose; as the original
of the Corinthian capital was taken from nothing more,
as is said, than some dock-leaves growing up against
a basket. Even a capital composed of the aukward and
confin'd forms of hats and periwigs, as fig. [48 p. I] in a
skilful hand might be made to have some beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/48.jpg" width="203" height="251" alt="48" />
</div>

<p>However, tho' the moderns have not made many
additions to the art of building, with respect to mere
beauty or ornament, yet it must be confess'd, they have
carried simplicity, convenience, and neatness of workmanship,
to a very great degree of perfection, particularly
in England; where plain good sense hath prefer'd
these more necessary parts of beauty, which every body
can understand, to that richness of taste which is so
much to be seen in other countries, and so often substituted
in their room.</p>

<p>St. Paul's cathedral is one of the noblest instances
that can be produced of the most judicious application
of every principle that has been spoken of. There you
may see the utmost variety without confusion, simplicity
without nakedness, richness without taudriness, distinctness
without hardness, and quantity without excess.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Whence the eye is entertain'd throughout with
the charming variety of all its parts together; the noble
projecting quantity of a certain number of them, which
presents bold and distinct parts at a distance, when the
lesser parts within them disappear; and the grand few,
but remarkably well-varied parts that continue to please
the eye as long as the object is discernable, are evident
proofs of the superior skill of Sir Christopher Wren, so
justly esteem'd the prince of architects.</p>

<p>It will scarcely admit of a dispute, that the outside
of this building is much more perfect than that of
St. Peter's at Rome: but the inside, though as fine and
noble, as the space it stands on, and our religion will
allow of, must give way to the splendor, shew, and
magnificence of that of St. Peter's, on account of the
sculptures and paintings, as well as the greater magnitude
of the whole, which makes it excel as to quantity.</p>

<p>There are many other churches of great beauty, the
work of the same architect, which are hid in the heart
of the city, whose steeples and spires are raised higher
than ordinary, that they may be seen at a distance above
the other buildings; and the great number of them
dispers'd about the whole city, adorn the prospect of it,
and give it an air of opulence and magnificence: on
which account their shapes will be found to be particularly
beautiful. Of these, and perhaps of any in
Europe, St. Mary-le-Bow is the most elegantly varied.
St. Bride's in Fleet-street diminishes sweetly by elegant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
degrees, but its variations, tho' very curious when you
are near them, not being quite so bold, and distinct, as
those of Bow, it too soon looses variety at a distance.
Some gothic spires are finely and artfully varied, particularly
the famous steeple of Strasburg.</p>

<p>Westminster-Abbey is a good contrast to St. Paul's,
with regard to simplicity and distinctness, the great
number of its filligrean ornaments, and small divided and
subdivided parts appear confused when nigh, and are
totally lost at a moderate distance; yet there is nevertheless
such a consistency of parts altogether in a good
gothic taste, and such propriety relative to the gloomy
ideas, they were then calculated to convey, that they
have at length acquir'd an establish'd and distinct character
in building. It would be look'd upon as an impropriety
and as a kind of profanation to build places
for mirth and entertainment in the same taste.</p>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Composition</span> with the <span class="smcap">Waving-Line</span></i>.</h3>


<p>There is scarce a room in any house whatever,
where one does not see the waving-line employ'd in
some way or other. How inelegant would the shapes
of all our moveables be without it? how very plain and
unornamental the mouldings of cornices, and chimney-pieces,
without the variety introduced by the <i>ogee</i> member,
which is entirely composed of waving-lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/49-50.jpg" width="400" height="168" alt="figs 49 and 50" />
</div>

<p>Though all sorts of waving-lines are ornamental,
when properly applied; yet, strictly speaking, there is
but one precise line, properly to be called the line of
<i>beauty</i>, which in the scale of them [Fig. 49 T p. I] is number 4: the
lines 5, 6, 7, by their bulging too much in their curvature
becoming gross and clumsy; and, on the contrary,
3, 2, 1, as they straighten, becoming mean and poor; as
will appear in the next figure [50 T p. I] where they are applied
to the legs of chairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 637px;">
<img src="images/53.jpg" width="637" height="94" alt="53" />
<div class="caption">53</div>
</div>

<p>A still more perfect idea of the effects of the precise
waving-line, and of those lines that deviate from it, may
be conceived by the row of stays, figure [53 B p. I], where number
4 is composed of precise waving-lines, and is therefore
the best shaped stay. Every whale-bone of a
good stay must be made to bend in this manner: for
the whole stay, when put close together behind, is truly
a shell of well-varied contents, and its surface of course
a fine form; so that if a line, or the lace were to be
drawn, or brought from the top of the lacing of the stay
behind, round the body, and down to the bottom peak
of the stomacher; it would form such a perfect, precise,
serpentine-line, as has been shewn, round the cone,
figure 26 in plate I.&mdash;&mdash;For this reason all ornaments
obliquely contrasting the body in this manner, as the
ribbons worn by the knights of the garter, are both
genteel and graceful. The numbers 5, 6, 7 and 3,
2, 1, are deviations into stiffness and meanness on one
hand, and clumsiness and deformity on the other. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
reasons for which disagreeable effects, after what has been
already said, will be evident to the meanest capacity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;">
<img src="images/26.jpg" width="505" height="154" alt="26" />
</div>

<p>It may be worth our notice however, that the stay,
number 2, would better fit a well-shaped man than
number 4; and that number 4, would better fit a well-form'd
woman, than number 2; and when on considering
them, merely as to their forms, and comparing them
together as you would two vases, it has been shewn
by our principles, how much finer and more beautiful
number 4 is, than number 2: does not this our determination
enhance the merit of these principles, as it
proves at the same time how much the form of a woman's
body surpasses in beauty that of a man?</p>

<p>From the examples that have been given, enough
may be gathered to carry on our observations from them
to any other objects that may chance to come in our
way, either animate or inanimate; so that we may not
only <i>lineally</i> account for the ugliness of the toad, the
hog, the bear, and the spider, which are totally void of
this waving-line, but also for the different degrees of
beauty belonging to those objects that possess it.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Compositions</span> with the <span class="smcap">Serpentine-Line</span></i>.</h3>


<p>The very great difficulty there is in describing this
line, either in words, or by the pencil (as was hinted
before, when I first mention'd it) will make it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
for me to proceed very slowly in what I have to say in
this chapter, and to beg the reader's patience whilst
I lead him step by step into the knowledge of what I
think the sublime in form, so remarkably display'd in
the human body; in which, I believe, when he is once
acquainted with the idea of them, he will find this species
of lines to be principally concern'd.</p>

<p>First, then, let him consider fig. [56 B p. II], which represents a
straight horn, with its contents, and he will find, as it
varies like the cone, it is a form of some beauty, merely
on that account.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/56.jpg" width="252" height="250" alt="56" />
</div>

<p>Next let him observe in what manner, and in what
degree the beauty of this horn is increas'd, in fig. [57 B p. II],
where it is supposed to be bent two different ways.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">
<img src="images/57.jpg" width="251" height="254" alt="57" />
</div>

<p>And lastly, let him attend to the vast increase of
beauty, even to grace and elegance, in the same horn,
fig. [58 B p. II], where it is supposed to have been twisted round,
at the same time, that it was bent two different ways,
(as in the last figure).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 248px;">
<img src="images/58.jpg" width="248" height="257" alt="58" />
</div>

<p>In the first of these figures, the dotted line down the
middle expresses the straight lines of which it is composed;
which, without the assistance of curve lines,
or light and shade, would hardly shew it to have
contents.</p>

<p>The same is true of the second, tho' by the bending
of the horn, the straight dotted line is changed into the
beautiful waving-line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>But in the last, this dotted line, by the twisting as
well as the bending of the horn, is changed from the
waving into the serpentine-line; which, as it dips
out of sight behind the horn in the middle, and returns
again at the smaller end, not only gives play to the imagination,
and delights the eye, on that account; but
informs it likewise of the quantity and variety of the
contents.</p>

<p>I have chosen this simple example, as the easiest way
of giving a plain and general idea of the peculiar qualities
of these serpentine-lines, and the advantages of
bringing them into compositions, where the contents
you are to express, admit of grace and elegance.</p>

<p>And I beg the same things may be understood of
these serpentine-lines, that I have said before of the
waving-lines. For as among the vast variety of waving-lines
that may be conceiv'd, there is but one that truly
deserves the name of <i>the line of beauty</i>, so there is
only one precise serpentine-line that I call <i>the line of
grace</i>. Yet, even when they are made too bulging, or
too tapering, though they certainly lose of their beauty
and grace, they do not become so wholly void of it,
as not to be of excellent service in compositions, where
beauty and grace are not particularly design'd to be express'd
in their greatest perfection.</p>

<p>Though I have distinguish'd these lines so particularly
as to give them the titles of <i>the lines of beauty and grace</i>,
I mean that the use and application of them should still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
be confined by the principles I have laid down for composition
in general; and that they should be judiciously
mixt and combined with one another, and even with those
I may term <i>plain</i> lines, (in opposition to these) as
the subject in hand requires. Thus the cornu-copia,
fig. [59 B p. II], is twisted and bent after the same manner, as the
last figure of the horn; but more ornamented, and with
a greater number of other lines of the same twisted
kind, winding round it with as quick returns as those
of a screw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 254px;">
<img src="images/59.jpg" width="254" height="261" alt="59" />
</div>

<p>This sort of form may be seen with yet more variations,
(and therefore more beautiful) in the goat's horn,
from which, in all probability, the ancients originally
took the extremely elegant forms they have given their
cornu-copias.</p>

<p>There is another way of considering this last figure
of the horn I would recommend to my reader, in order
to give him a clearer idea of the use both of the waving
and serpentine-lines in composition.</p>

<p>This is to imagine the horn, thus bent and twisted,
to be cut length-ways by a very fine saw into two equal
parts; and to observe one of these in the same position
the whole horn is represented in; and these two
observations will naturally occur to him. First, that
the edge of the saw must run from one end to the other
of the horn in the line of beauty; so that the edges of
this half of the horn will have a beautiful shape: and,
secondly, that wherever the dotted serpentine-line on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
surface of the whole horn dips behind, and is lost to
the eye, it immediately comes into sight on the hollow
surface of the divided horn.</p>

<p>The use I shall make of these observations will appear
very considerable in the application of them to the human
form, which we are next to attempt.</p>

<p>It will be sufficient, therefore, at present only to observe,
first, that the whole horn acquires a beauty by its
being thus genteely bent two different ways; secondly,
that whatever lines are drawn on its external surface become
graceful, as they must all of them, from the twist
that is given the horn, partake in some degree or other,
of the shape of the serpentine-line: and, lastly, when
the horn is split, and the inner, as well as the outward
surface of its shell-like form is exposed, the eye is peculiarly
entertained and relieved in the pursuit of these
serpentine-lines, as in their twistings their concavities
and convexities are alternately offer'd to its view. Hollow
forms, therefore, composed of such lines are extremely
beautiful and pleasing to the eye; in many cases
more so, than those of solid bodies.</p>

<p>Almost all the muscles, and bones, of which the human
form is composed, have more, or less of these kind
of twists in them; and give in a less degree, the same
kind of appearance to the parts which cover them, and
are the immediate object of the eye: and for this reason
it is that I have been so particular in describing these
forms of the bent, and twisted, and ornamented horn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>There is scarce a straight bone in the whole body.
Almost all of them are not only bent different ways,
but have a kind of twist, which in some of them is very
graceful; and the muscles annex'd to them, tho' they
are of various shapes, appropriated to their particular
uses, generally have their component fibres running in
these serpentine-lines, surrounding and conforming
themselves to the varied shape of the bones they belong
to: more especially in the limbs. Anatomists are so
satisfied of this, that they take a pleasure in distinguishing
their several beauties. I shall only instance in the
thigh-bone, and those about the hips.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 230px;">
<img src="images/62-64.jpg" width="230" height="480" alt="figs 62 and 64" />
</div>

<p>The thigh-bone fig. [62 R p. II], has the waving and twisted
turn of the horn, 58: but the beautiful bones adjoining,
call'd the ossa innominata [Fig. 60 B p. II], have, with greater variety,
the same turns and twists of that horn when it is cut;
and its inner and outward surfaces are exposed to the
eye.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/60-61-63.jpg" width="500" height="180" alt="figs 60, 61 and 63" />
</div>

<p>How ornamental these bones appear, when the prejudice
we conceive against them, as being part of a skeleton,
is taken off, by adding a little foliage to them,
may be seen in fig. [61 B p. II]&mdash;&mdash;such shell-like winding forms,
mixt with foliage, twisting about them, are made use
of in all ornaments; a kind of composition calculated
merely to please the eye. Divest these of their serpentine
twinings, and they immediately lose all grace, and return
to the poor gothic taste they were in an hundred years
ago [Fig. 63 B p. II].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 230px;">
<img src="images/62-64.jpg" width="230" height="480" alt="figs 62 and 64" />
</div>

<p>Fig. [64 B p. II] is meant to represent the manner, in which
most of the muscles, (those of the limbs in particular) are
twisted round the bones, and conform themselves to their
length and shape; but with no anatomical exactness.
As to the running of their fibres, some anatomists have
compared them to skains of thread, loose in the middle,
and tight at each end, which, when they are thus consider'd
as twisted contrary ways round the bone, gives the
strongest idea possible of a composition of serpentine-lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">
<img src="images/65-67.jpg" width="398" height="562" alt="65 66 67" />
</div>

<p>Of these fine winding forms then are the muscles and bones
composed, and which, by their varied situations with each
other, become more intricately pleasing, and form a continued
waving of winding forms from one into the other,
as may be best seen by examining a good anatomical
figure, part of which you have here represented, in the
muscular leg and thigh, fig. [65 p. I]: which shews the serpentine
forms and varied situations of the muscles, as they
appear when the skin is taken off. It was drawn from
a plaster of paris figure cast off nature, the original of
which was prepared for the mould by Cowper, the famous
anatomist. In this last figure, as the skin is taken off
the parts are too distinctly traced by the eye, for that
intricate delicacy which is necessary to the utmost
beauty; yet the winding figures of the muscles, with
the variety of their situations, must always be allow'd
elegant forms: however, they lose in the imagination
some of the beauty, which they really have, by the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of their being flayed; nevertheless, by what has already
been shewn both of them and the bones, the human
frame hath more of its parts composed of serpentine-lines
than any other object in nature; which is a proof
both of its superior beauty to all others, and, at the
same time, that its beauty proceeds from those lines:
for although they may be required sometimes to be
bulging in their twists, as in the thick swelling muscles
of the Hercules, yet elegance and greatness of taste is
still preserved; but when these lines lose so much of
their twists as to become almost straight, all elegance
of taste vanishes.</p>

<p>Thus fig. [66 p. I], was also taken from nature, and drawn
in the same position, but treated in a more dry, stiff,
and what the painters call, <i>sticky manner</i>, than the nature
of flesh is ever capable of appearing in, unless when its
moisture is dryed away: it must be allowed, that the
parts of this figure are of as right dimensions, and as
truly situated, as in the former; it wants only the true
twist of the lines to give it taste.</p>

<p>To prove this further, and to put the mean effect
of these plain or unvaried lines in a stronger light,
see fig. [67 p. I], where, by the uniform, unvaried shapes and situation
of the muscles, without so much as a waving-line
in them, it becomes so wooden a form, that he that
can fashion the leg of a joint-stool may carve this figure
as well as the best sculptor. In the same manner,
divest one of the best antique statues of all its
serpentine winding parts, and it becomes from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
exquisite piece of art, a figure of such ordinary lines
and unvaried contents, that a common stone-mason or
carpenter, with the help of his rule, calipers, and
compasses, might carve out an exact imitation of it:
and were it not for these lines a turner, in his lathe,
might turn a much finer neck than that of the grecian
Venus, as according to the common notion of a
beautiful neck, it would be more truly round. For
the same reason, legs much swoln with disease, are as
easy to imitate as a post, having lost their <i>drawing</i>, as
the painters call it; that is, having their serpentine-lines
all effaced, by the skin's being equally puffed up, as
figure [68].</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;">
<img src="images/68.jpg" width="487" height="192" alt="68" />
</div>

<p>If in comparing these three figures one with another,
the reader, notwithstanding the prejudice his imagination
may have conceiv'd against them, as anatomical
figures, has been enabled only to perceive that one of
them is not so disagreeable as the others; he will easily
be led to see further, that this tendency to beauty in
one, is not owing to any greater degree of exactness in
the <i>proportions</i> of its parts, but merely to the more
<i>pleasing turns, and intertwistings of the lines,</i> which compose
its external form; for in all the three figures the
same proportions have been observ'd, and, on that account,
they have all an equal claim to beauty.</p>

<p>And if he pursues this anatomical enquiry but a very
little further, just to form a true idea of the elegant
use that is made of the skin and fat beneath it, to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
from the eye all that is hard and disagreeable, and
at the same time to preserve to it whatever is necessary
in the shapes of the parts beneath, to give grace and
beauty to the whole limb: he will find himself insensibly
led into the principles of that grace and beauty
which is to be found in well-turn'd limbs, in fine, elegant,
healthy life, or in those of the best antique statues;
as well as into the reason why his eye has so often
unknowingly been pleased and delighted with them.</p>

<p>Thus, in all other parts of the body, as well as these,
wherever, for the sake of the necessary motion of the
parts, with proper strength and agility, the insertions
of the muscles are too hard and sudden, their swellings
too bold, or the hollows between them too deep, for
their out-lines to be beautiful; nature most judiciously
softens these hardnesses, and plumps up these vacancies
with a proper supply of fat, and covers the whole with
the soft, smooth, springy, and, in delicate life, almost
transparent skin, which, conforming itself to the external
shape of all the parts beneath, expresses to the
eye the idea of its contents with the utmost delicacy of
beauty and grace.</p>

<p>The skin, therefore, thus tenderly embracing, and
gently conforming itself to the varied shapes of every
one of the outward muscles of the body, soften'd underneath
by the fat, where, otherwise, the same hard lines
and furrows would appear, as we find come on with
age in the face, and with labour, in the limbs, is evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
a shell-like surface (to keep up the idea I set out
with) form'd with the utmost delicacy in nature; and
therefore the most proper subject of the study of every
one, who desires to imitate the works of nature, <i>as a
master should do</i>, or to judge of the performances of
others <i>as a real connoisseur ought</i>.</p>

<p>I cannot be too long, I think, on this subject, as so
much will be found to depend upon it; and therefore
shall endeavour to give a clear idea of the different effect
such anatomical figures have on the eye, from what
the same parts have, when cover'd by the fat and skin;
by supposing a small wire (that has lost its spring and so
will retain every shape it is twisted into) to be held fast
to the out-side of the hip (fig. 65. plate I) and thence brought
down the other side of the thigh obliquely over the calf
of the leg, down to the outward ancle (all the while
press'd so close as to touch and conform itself to the
shape of every muscle it passes over) and then to be taken
off. If this wire be now examined it will be found that
the general uninterrupted flowing twist, which the winding
round the limbs would otherwise have given to it,
is broken into little better than so many separate plain
curves, by the sharp indentures it every where has receiv'd
on being closely press'd in between the muscles.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 398px;">
<img src="images/65-67.jpg" width="398" height="562" alt="65 66 67" />
</div>

<p>Suppose, in the next place, such a wire was in the
same manner twisted round a living well-shaped leg
and thigh, or those of a fine statue; when you take it
off you will find no such sharp indentures, nor any of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
those regular <i>engralings</i> (as the heralds express it) which
displeased the eye before. On the contrary, you will
see how <i>gradually</i> the changes in its shape are produced;
how imperceptibly the different curvatures run
into each other, and how easily the eye glides along
the varied wavings of its sweep. To enforce this still
further, if a line were to be drawn by a pencil exactly
where these wires have been supposed to pass, the point
of the pencil, in the muscular leg and thigh, would perpetually
meet with stops and rubs, whilst in the others
it would flow from muscle to muscle along the elastic
skin, as pleasantly as the lightest skiff dances over the
gentlest wave.</p>

<p>This idea of the wire, retaining thus the shape of the
parts it passes over, seems of so much consequence, that
I would by no means have it forgot; as it may properly
be consider'd as one of the threads (or outlines) of the
shell (or external surface) of the human form: and the
frequently recurring to it will assist the imagination in
its conceptions of those parts of it, whose shapes are
most intricately varied: for the same sort of observations
may be made, with equal justice, on the shapes of
ever so many such wires twisted in the same manner in
ever so many directions over every part of a well made
man, woman, or statue.</p>

<p>And if the reader will follow in his imagination the
most exquisite turns of the chisel in the hands of a
master, when he is putting the finishing touches to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
statue; he will soon be led to understand what it is
the real judges expect from the hand of such a master,
which the Italians call, the little more, Il poco piu, and
which in reality distinguishes the original master-pieces
at Rome from even the best copies of them.</p>

<p>An example or two will sufficiently explain what is
here meant; for as these exquisite turns are to be found,
in some degree of beauty or other, all over the whole
surface of the body and limbs: we may by taking any
one part of a fine figure (though so small a one that
only a few muscles are express'd in it) explain the
manner in which so much beauty and grace has been given
to them, as to convince a skilful artist, almost at
sight, that it must have been the work of a master.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;">
<img src="images/76.jpg" width="436" height="361" alt="76" />
</div>

<p>I have chosen, for this purpose, a small piece
of the body of a statue, fig. [76 T p. II], representing part of the left
side under the arm, together with a little of the breast,
(including a very particular muscle, which, from the
likeness its edges bear to the teeth of a saw, is, if consider'd
by itself, void of beauty) as most proper to the
point in hand, because this its regular shape more peculiarly
requires the skill of the artist to give it a little
more variety than it generally has, even in nature.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/77.jpg" width="452" height="302" alt="77" />
</div>

<p>First, then, I will give you a representation of this
part of the body, from an anatomical figure [Fig. 77 T p. II], to show
what a sameness there is in the shapes of all the teeth-like
insertions of this muscle; and how regularly the
fibres, which compose it, follow the almost parallel out-lines
of the ribs they partly cover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">
<img src="images/78.jpg" width="432" height="358" alt="78" />
</div>

<p>From what has been said before of the use of the
natural covering of the skin, &amp;c. the next figure [78 T p. II] will
easily be understood to mean so tame a representation
of the same part of the body, that tho' the hard and stiff
appearance of the edges of this muscle is taken off by
that covering, yet enough of its regularity and sameness
remains to render it disagreeable.</p>

<p>Now as regularity and sameness, according to our
doctrine, is want of elegance and true taste, we shall
endeavour in the next place to show how this very part
(in which the muscles take so very regular a form) may
be brought to have as much variety as any other part
of the body whatever. In order to this, though some
alteration must be made in almost every part of it, yet
it should be so inconsiderable in each, that no remarkable
change may appear in the shape and situation of
any.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 262px;">
<img src="images/79-81.jpg" width="262" height="308" alt="figs 79, 80 and 81" />
</div>

<p>Thus, let the parts mark'd 1, 2, 3, 4, (which appear
so exactly similar in shape, and parallel in situation
in the muscular figure 77) and not much mended
in fig. 78, be first varied in their sizes, but not gradually
from the uppermost to the lowest, as in fig. [79 T p. II],
nor alternately one long and one short, as in fig. [80 T p. II], for
in either of these cases there would still remain too great
a formality. We should therefore endeavour, in the
next place, to vary them every way in our power, without
losing entirely the true idea of the parts themselves.
Suppose them then to have changed their situations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
a little, and slip'd beside each other irregularly,
(some how as is represented in fig. [81 T p. II], merely with regard
to their situation) and the external appearance of
the whole piece of the body, now under our consideration,
will assume the more varied and pleasing form,
represented in fig. 76, easily to be discern'd by comparing
the three figures, 76, 77, 78, one with another;
and it will as easily be seen, that were lines to be drawn,
or wires to be bent, over these muscles, from one to the
other, and so on to the adjoining parts; they would
have a continued waving flow, let them pass in any
direction whatever.</p>

<p>The unskilful, in drawing these parts after the life, as
their regularities are much more easily seen and copied
than their fine variations, seldom fail of making them
more regular and poor than they really appear even
in a consumptive person.</p>

<p>The difference will appear evident by comparing
fig. 78, purposely drawn in this tasteless manner, with
fig. 76. But will be more perfectly understood by examining
this part in the Torso of Michael Angelo [Fig. 54 p. I],
whence this figure was taken.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/54.jpg" width="301" height="257" alt="54" />
</div>

<p>Note, there are casts of a small copy of that famous
trunk of a body to be had at almost every plaster-figure
makers, wherein what has been here described may be
sufficiently seen, not only in the part which figure 76
was taken from, but all over that curious piece of antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>I must here again press my reader to a particular
attention to the windings of these superficial lines, even
in their passing over every joint, what alterations soever
may be made in the surface of the skin by the various
bendings of the limbs: and tho' the space allow'd
for it, just in the joints, be ever so small, and consequently
the lines ever so short, the application of this
principle of varying these lines, as far as their lengths
will admit of, will be found to have its effect as gracefully
as in the more lengthen'd muscles of the body.</p>

<p>It should be observ'd in the fingers, where the joints
are but short, and the tendons straight; and where
beauty seems to submit, in some degree, to use, yet not
so much but you trace in a full-grown taper finger,
these little winding lines among the wrinkles, or in
(what is more pretty because more simple) the dimples
of the nuckles. As we always distinguish things best
by seeing their reverse set in opposition with them; if
fig. 82 T p. II, by the straightness of its lines, shews fig. 83 T p. II, to
have some little taste in it, tho' it is so slightly sketch'd;
the difference will more evidently appear when you in
like manner compare a straight coarse finger in common
life with the taper dimpled one of a fine lady.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 203px;">
<img src="images/82-83.jpg" width="203" height="312" alt="figs 82 and 83" />
</div>

<p>There is an elegant degree of plumpness peculiar to
the skin of the softer sex, that occasions these delicate
dimplings in all their other joints, as well as these of
the fingers; which so perfectly distinguishes them from
those even of a graceful man; and which, assisted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
the more soften'd shapes of the muscles underneath,
presents to the eye all the varieties in the whole figure
of the body, with gentler and fewer parts more sweetly
connected together, and with such a fine simplicity as
will always give the turn of the female frame, represented
in the Venus [Fig. 13 p. I], the preference to that of the
Apollo [Fig. 12 p. I].</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">
<img src="images/13-12.jpg" width="434" height="402" alt="figs 13 and 12" />
</div>

<p>Now whoever can conceive lines thus constantly flowing,
and delicately varying over every part of the body
even to the fingers ends, and will call to his remembrance
what led us to this last description of what the
Italians call, Il poco piu (<i>the little more</i> that is expected
from the hand of a master) will, in my mind, want
very little more than what his own observation on the
works of art and nature will lead him to, to acquire
a true idea of the word <i>Taste</i>, when applied to form;
however inexplicable this word may hitherto have been
imagined.</p>

<p>We have all along had recourse chiefly to the works of
the ancients, not because the moderns have not produced
some as excellent; but because the works of
the former are more generally known: nor would we
have it thought, that either of them have ever yet
come up to the utmost beauty of nature. Who but a
bigot, even to the antiques, will say that he has not
seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women,
that even the Grecian Venus doth but coarsely imitate?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>And what sufficient reason can be given why the
same may not be said of the rest of the body?</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h4><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Proportion</span></i>.</h3>


<p>If anyone should ask, what it is that constitutes a
fine-proportion'd human figure? how ready and
seemingly decisive is the common answer: <i>a just symmetry
and harmony of parts with respect to the whole</i>.
But as probably this vague answer took its rise from
doctrines not belonging to form, or idle schemes built
on them, I apprehend it will cease to be thought much
to the purpose after a proper enquiry has been made.</p>

<p>Preparatory to which, it becomes necessary in this
place, to mention one reason more which may be added
to those given in the introduction, for my having persuaded
the reader to consider objects scoop'd out like
thin shells; which is, that partly by this conception,
he may be the better able to separate and keep asunder
the two following <i>general ideas</i>, as we will call them,
belonging to form; which are apt to coincide and mix
with each other in the mind, and which it is necessary
(for the sake of making each more fully and particularly
clear) should be kept apart, and consider'd singly.</p>

<p>First, the <i>general ideas</i> of what hath already been discussed
in the foregoing chapters, which only comprehends
the surface of form, viewing it in no other light
than merely as being ornamental or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, that <i>general idea</i>, now to be discussed, which
we commonly have of form altogether, as arising chiefly
from a fitness to some design'd purpose or use.</p>

<p>Hitherto our main drift hath been to establish and
illustrate the first idea only, by shewing, first the nature
of variety, and then its effects on the mind; with the
manner how such impressions are made by means of the
different feelings given to the eye, from its movements
in tracing and coursing<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> over surfaces of all kinds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> See Chapter V, page <a href="#Page_25">25</a>.</p></div>

<p>The surface of a piece of ornament, that hath every
turn in it that lines are capable of moving into, and at
the same time no way applied, nor of any manner of
use, but merely to entertain the eye, would be such an
object as would answer to this first idea alone.</p>

<p>The figure like a leaf, at the bottom of plate I, near
to fig. 67, is something of this kind; it was taken from
an ash-tree, and was a sort of Lusus naturæ, growing
only like an excressence, but so beautiful in the lines of
its shell-like windings, as would have been above the
power of a Gibbons to have equalled, even in its own
materials; nor could the graver of an Edlinck, or Drevet,
have done it justice on copper.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 241px;">
<img src="images/e.jpg" width="241" height="344" alt="fig nr 67 pl I" />
</div>

<p>Note, the present taste of ornaments seems to have
been partly taken from productions of this sort, which
are to be found about autumn among plants, particularly
asparagus, when it is running to seed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall now endeavour to explain what is included in
what I have called for distinction sake, the second <i>general
idea</i> of form, in a much fuller manner than was
done in Chapter I, of Fitness. And begin with observing,
that though surfaces will unavoidably be still included,
yet we must no longer confine ourselves to the particular
notice of them as surfaces only, as we heretofore
have done; we must now open our view to general, as
well as particular bulk and solidity; and also look into
what may have filled up, or given rise thereto, such as
certain <i>given</i> quantities and dimensions of parts, for inclosing
any substance, or for performing of <i>motion, purchase,
stedfastness,</i> and other matters of use to living
beings, which, I apprehend, at length, will bring us to
a tolerable conception of the word <i>proportion</i>.</p>

<p>As to these <i>joint-sensations</i> of bulk and motion, do
we not at first sight almost, even without making trial,
seem to <i>feel</i> when a leaver of any kind is too weak, or
not long enough to make such or such a purchase? or
when a spring is not sufficient? and don't we find by
experience what weight, or dimension should be given,
or taken away, on this or that account? if so, as the
general as well as particular bulks of form, are made up
of materials moulded together under mechanical directions,
for some known purpose or other; how naturally,
from these considerations, shall we fall into a judgment
of <i>fit proportion</i>; which is one part of beauty to the
mind tho' not always so to the eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Our necessities have taught us to mould matter into
various shapes, and to give them fit proportions
for particular uses, as bottles, glasses, knives, dishes,
&amp;c. Hath not offence given rise to the form of the
sword, and defence to that of the shield? And what
else but proper fitness of parts hath fix'd the different
dimensions of pistols, muskets, great guns, fowling-pieces
and blunderbusses; which differences as to figure,
may as properly be called the different characters of fire-arms,
as the different shapes of men are called characters
of men.</p>

<p>We find also that the profuse variety of shapes, which
present themselves from the whole animal creation, arise
chiefly from the nice fitness of their parts, designed for
accomplishing the peculiar movements of each.</p>

<p>And here I think will be the proper place to speak
of a most curious difference between the living machines
of nature, in respect of fitness, and such poor ones,
in comparison with them, as men are only capable of
making; by means of which distinction, I am in hopes
of shewing what particularly constitutes the utmost
beauty of proportion in the human figure.</p>

<p>A clock, by the government's order, has been made,
and another now making, by Mr. Harrison, for the keeping
of true time at sea; which perhaps is one of the most
exquisite movements ever made. Happy the ingenious
contriver! although the form of the whole, or of every
part of this curious machine, should be ever so confused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
or displeasingly shaped to the eye; and although even
its movements should be disagreeable to look at, provided
it answers the end proposed. An ornamental composition
was no part of his scheme, otherwise than as a
pollish might be necessary. If ornaments are required to
be added to mend its shape, care must be taken that
they are no obstruction to the movement itself, and the
more as they would be superfluous, as to the main design.&mdash;But
in nature's machines, how wonderfully do
we see beauty and use go hand in hand!</p>

<p>Had a machine for this purpose been nature's work,
the whole and every individual part would have had
exquisite beauty of form without danger of destroying
the exquisiteness of its motion, even as if ornament had
been the sole aim; its movements too would have been
graceful, without one superfluous tittle added for either
of these lovely purposes.&mdash;Now this is that curious difference
between the fitness of nature's machines (one of
which is man) and those made by mortal hands: which
distinction is to lead us to our main point proposed; I
mean, to the shewing what constitutes the utmost beauty
of proportion.</p>

<p>There was brought from France some years ago, a
little clock-work machine, with a duck's head and legs
fixt to it, which was so contrived as to have some resemblance
of that animal standing upon one foot, and
stretching back its leg, turning its head, opening and
shutting its bill, moving its wings, and shaking its tail;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
all of them the plainest and easiest directions in living
movements: yet for the poorly performing of these few
motions, this silly, but much extoll'd machine, being uncover'd,
appeared a most complicated, confused, and disagreeable
object: nor would its being covered with a
skin closely adhering to its parts, as that of a real duck's
doth, have much mended its figure; at best, a bag of
hob-nails, broken hinges, and patten-rings, would have
looked as well, unless by other means it had been stuffed
out to bring it into form.</p>

<p>Thus again you see, the more variety we pretend to
give to our trifling movements, the more confused and
unornamental the forms become; nay chance but seldom
helps them.&mdash;How much the reverse are nature's!
the greater the variety her movements have, the more
beautiful are the parts that cause them.</p>

<p>The finny race of animals, as they have fewer motions
than other creatures, so are their forms less remarkable
for beauty. It is also to be noted of every species,
that the handsomest of each move best: birds of a
clumsy make seldom fly well, nor do lumpy fish glide
so well through the water as those of a neater make;
and beasts of the most elegant form, always excel in
speed; of this, the horse and greyhound are beautiful
examples: and even among themselves, the most elegantly
made seldom fail of being the swiftest.</p>

<p>The war-horse is more equally made for strength
than the race-horse, which surplus of power in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
former, if suppos'd added to the latter, as it would throw
more weight into improper parts for the business of mere
speed, so of course it would lessen, in some degree, that
admirable quality, and partly destroy that delicate fitness
of his make; but then a quality in movement, superior
to that of speed, would be given to him by the
addition, as he would be render'd thereby more fit to
move with ease in such varied, or graceful directions, as
are so delightful to the eye in the carriage of the fine
manag'd war-horse; and as at the same time, something
stately and graceful would be added to his figure, which
before could only be said to have an elegant neatness.
This noble creature stands foremost among brutes; and
it is but consistent with nature's propriety, that the most
useful animal in the brute-creation, should be thus signalized
also for the most beauty.</p>

<p>Yet, properly speaking, no living creatures are capable
of moving in such truly varied and graceful directions,
as the human species; and it would be needless to say
how much superior in beauty their forms and textures
likewise are. And surely also after what has been said
relating to figure and motion, it is plain and evident
that nature has thought fit to make beauty of proportion,
and beauty of movement, necessary to each other: so
that the observation before made on animals, will hold
equally good with regard to man: i. e. that he who is
most exquisitely well-proportion'd is most capable of
exquisite movements, such as ease and <i>grace in deportment</i>,
or in dancing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be a sort of collateral confirmation of what
has been said of this method of nature's working, as
well as otherwise worth our notice, that when any parts
belonging to the human body are conceal'd, and not immediately
concern'd in movement, all such ornamental
shapes, as evidently appear in the muscles and bones<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>,
are totally neglected as unnecessary, for nature doth nothing
in vain! this is plainly the case of the intestines,
none of them having the least beauty, as to form, except
the <i>heart</i>; which noble part, and indeed kind of
first mover, is a simple and well-varied figure; conformable
to which, some of the most elegant Roman
urns and vases have been fashion'd.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> See <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX</a> on Compositions with the Serpentine-line.</p></div>

<p>Now, thus much being kept in remembrance, our
next step will be to speak of, first, general measurements;
such as the whole height of the body to its
breadth, or the length of a limb to its thickness: and,
secondly, of such appearances of dimensions as are too
intricately varied to admit of a description by lines.</p>

<p>The former will be confined to a very few straight
lines, crossing each other, which will easily be understood
by everyone; but the latter will require somewhat
more attention, because it will extend to the precision
of every modification, bound, or limit, of the
human figure.</p>

<p>To be somewhat more explicit. As to the first part,
I shall begin with shewing what practicable sort of measuring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
may be used in order to produce the most proper
variety in the proportions of the parts of any body. I
say, <i>practicable</i>, because the vast variety of intricately
situated parts, belonging to the human form, will not
admit of measuring the distances of one part by another,
by lines or points, beyond a certain degree or number,
without great perplexity in the operation itself, or confusion
to the imagination. For instance, say, a line representing
one breadth and an half of the wrist, would
be equal to the true breadth of the thickest part of the
arm above the elbow; may it not then be ask'd, what
part of the wrist is meant? for if you place a pair of
calipers a little nearer or further from the hand, the
distance of the points will differ, and so they will if they
are moved close to the wrist all round, because it is
flatter one way than the other; but suppose, for argument
sake, one certain diameter should be fix'd upon;
may it not again be ask'd, how is it to be apply'd, if
to the flattest side of the arm or the roundest, and how
far from the elbow, and must it be when the arm is extended
or when it is bent? for this also will make a
sensible difference, because in the latter position, the
muscle, call'd the biceps, in the front of that part of
the arm, swells up like a ball one way, and narrows itself
another; nay all the muscles shift their appearances
in different movements, so that whatever may have been
pretended by some authors, no exact mathematical
measurements by lines, can be given for the true proportion
of a human body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 742px;">
<img src="images/68-55.jpg" width="742" height="192" alt="figs 68 and 55" />
</div>

<p>It comes then to this, that no longer than whilst we
suppose all the lengths and breadths of the body, or
limbs, to be as regular figures as cylinders, or as the leg,
figure 68 in plate I, which is as round as a rolling-stone,
are the measures of lengths to breadths practicable, or
of any use to the knowledge of proportion: so that as
all mathematical schemes are foreign to this purpose, we
will endeavour to root them quite out of our way:
therefore I must not omit taking notice, that Albert
Durer, Lomazzo, (see two tasteless figures taken from
their books of proportion [Fig. 55 p. I]) and some others, have not
only puzzled mankind with a heap of minute unnecessary
divisions, but also with a strange <i>notion</i> that those
divisions are govern'd by the laws of music; which mistake
they seem to have been led into, by having seen
certain uniform and consonant divisions upon one string
produce harmony to the ear, and by persuading themselves,
that similar distances in lines belonging to form,
would, in like manner, delight the eye. The very reverse
of which has been shewn to be true, in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III</a>,
on Uniformity. "The length of the foot," say they, "in
respect to the breadth, makes a <i>double suprabipartient</i>,
a <i>diapason</i>, and a <i>diatesseron</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>:" which, in my opinion,
would have been full as applicable to the ear, or to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
plant, or to a tree, or any other form whatsoever; yet
these sort of <i>notions</i> have so far prevail'd by time, that
the words, <i>harmony of parts</i>, seem as applicable to form,
as to music.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Note, these authors assure you, that this curious method of measuring,
<i>will produce beauty far beyond any nature doth afford</i>. Lomazzo,
recommends also another scheme, with a triangle, to correct the <i>poverty
of nature</i>, as they express themselves. These <i>nature-menders</i> put one in
mind of Gulliver's tailor at Laputa, who, having taken measure of
him for a suit of clothes, with a rule, quadrant, and compasses, after a
considerable time spent, brought them home ill-made.</p></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the absurdity of the above schemes,
such measures as are to be taken from antique statues,
may be of some service to painters and sculptors, especially
to young beginners, but nothing nigh of such
use to them, as the measures, taken the same way, from
ancient buildings, have been, and are, to architects and
builders; because the latter have to do with little else
but plain geometrical figures: which measures, however,
serve only in copying what has been done before.</p>

<p>The few measures I shall speak of, for the setting
out the general dimensions of a figure, shall be taken
by straight lines only, for the more easy conception of
what may indeed be properly call'd, <i>gaging the contents
of the body</i>, supposing it solid like a marble statue, as
the wires were described to do [Fig. 2 p. I] in the introduction:
by which plain method, clear ideas may be acquir'd of
what <i>alone</i> seem to me to require measuring, of what
certain lengths to what breadths make the most eligible
proportions in general.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 256px;">
<img src="images/2.jpg" width="256" height="382" alt="2" />

<p>The most general dimensions of a body, or limbs,
are lengths, breadths, or thicknesses: now the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
gentility of a figure, according to its character, depends
upon the first proportioning these lines or wires (which
are its measures) properly one to another; and the more
varied these lines are, with respect to each other, the
more may the future divisions be varied likewise, that
are to be made on them; and of course the less varied
these lines are, the parts influenced by them, as they
must conform themselves to them, must have less variety
too. For example, the exact cross [Fig. 69 R p. II] of two equal lines,
cutting each other in the middle, would confine the
figure of a man, drawn conformable to them, to the
disagreeable character of his being as broad as he is long.
And the two lines crossing each other, to make the height
and breadth of a figure, will want variety a contrary
way, by one line being very short in proportion to
the other, and therefore, also incapable of producing a
figure of tolerable variety. To prove this, it will be very
easy for the reader to make the experiment, by drawing
a figure or two (tho' ever so imperfectly) confin'd
within such limits.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 183px;">
<img src="images/69.jpg" width="183" height="164" alt="69" />
</div>

<p>There is a medium between these, proper for every
character, which the eye will easily and accurately determine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 189px;">
<img src="images/70.jpg" width="189" height="199" alt="70" />
</div>

<p>Thus, if the lines, fig. [70 R p. II], were to be the measure of
the extreme length and breadth, set out either for the
figure of a man or a vase, the eye soon sees the longest
of these is not quite sufficiently so, in proportion to the
other, for a genteel man; and yet it would make a vase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
too taper to be elegant; no rule or compasses would
decide this matter either so quickly or so precisely as a
good eye. It may be observed, that minute differences
in great lengths, are of little or no consequence as to
proportion, because they are not to be discerned; for a
man is half an inch shorter when he goes to bed at
night, than when he rises in the morning, without the
possibility of its being perceived. In case of a wager
the application of a rule or compasses may be necessary,
but seldom on any other occasion.</p>

<p>Thus much I apprehend is sufficient for the consideration
of general lengths to breadths. Where, by the
way, I apprehend I have plainly shewn, that there is
no practicable rule, by lines, for minutely setting out
proportions <i>for</i> the human body, and if there were, the
eye alone must determine us in our choice of what is
most pleasing to itself.</p>

<p>Thus having dispatch'd general dimension, which we
may say is almost as much of proportion, as is to be
seen when we have our cloaths on: I shall in the second,
and more extensive method proposed for considering it,
set out in the familiar path of common observation,
and appeal as I go on to our usual feeling, or joint-sensation,
of figure and motion.</p>

<p>Perhaps by mentioning two or three known instances it
will be found that almost every one is farther advanced in
the knowledge of this speculative part of proportion than
he imagines; especially he who hath been used to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
naked figures doing bodily exercise, and more especially
if he be any way interested in the success of them; and
the better he is acquainted with the nature of the exercise
itself, still the better judge he becomes of the figure
that is to perform it. For this reason, no sooner are
two boxers stript to fight, but even a butcher, thus skill'd,
shews himself a considerable critic in proportion; and
on this sort of judgment, often gives, or takes the odds,
at bare sight only of the combatants. I have heard a
blacksmith harangue like an anatomist, or sculptor, on the
beauty of a boxer's figure, tho' not perhaps in the same
terms; and I firmly believe, that one of our common
proficients in the athletic art, would be able to instruct
and direct the best sculptor living, (who hath not seen,
or is wholly ignorant of this exercise) in what would
give the statue of an English-boxer, a much better proportion,
as to character, than is to be seen, even in the
famous group of antique boxers, (or as some call them,
Roman wrestlers) so much admired to this day.</p>

<p>Indeed, as many parts of the body are so constantly
kept cover'd, the proportion of the whole cannot be
equally known; but as stockings are so close and thin a
covering, every one judges of the different shapes and
proportions of legs with great accuracy. The ladies
always speak skilfully of necks, hands, and arms; and
often will point out such particular beauties or defects
in their make, as might easily escape the observation of
a man of science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely, such determinations could not be made and
pronounced with such critical truth, if the eye were not
capable of measuring or judging of thicknesses by
lengths, with great preciseness. Nay more, in order to
determine so nicely as they often do, it must also at
the same time, trace with some skill those delicate
windings upon the surface which have been described
in page <a href="#Page_64">64</a> and <a href="#Page_65">65</a>, which altogether may be observ'd
to include the two general ideas mention'd at the beginning
of this chapter.</p>

<p>If so, certainly it is in the power of a man of science,
with as observing an eye, to go still further, and conceive,
with a very little turn of thought, many other
necessary circumstances concerning proportion, as of
what size and in what manner the bones help to make
up the bulk, and support the other parts; as well as
what certain weights or dimensions of muscles are proper
(according to the principle of the steelyard) to move
such or such a length of arm with this or that degree
of swiftness or force.</p>

<p>But though much of this matter, may be easily understood
by common observation, assisted by science,
still I fear it will be difficult to raise a very clear idea
of what constitutes, or composes the <i>utmost beauty of
proportion</i>; such as is seen in the Antinous; which is
allowed to be the most perfect in this respect, of any of
the antique statues; and tho' the lovely likewise seems
to have been as much the sculptor's aim, as in the Venus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
yet a manly strength in its proportion is equally express'd
from head to foot in it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 155px;">
<img src="images/6.jpg" width="155" height="357" alt="6" />
</div>

<p>Let us try, however, and as this master-piece of art
is so well known, we will set it up before us as a pattern,
and endeavour to fabricate, or put together in the
mind, such kind of parts as shall seem to build another
figure like it. In doing which, we shall soon find that
it is chiefly to be effected by means of the nice sensation
we naturally have of what certain quantities or dimensions
of parts, are fittest to produce the utmost strength
for moving, or supporting great weights; and of what
are most fit for the utmost light agility, as also for every
degree, between these two extremes.</p>

<p>He who hath best perfected his ideas of these matters
by common observations, and by the assistance of arts
relative thereto, will probably be most precisely just and
clear, in conceiving the application of the various parts
and dimensions, that will occur to him, in the following
descriptive manner of disposing of them, in order
to form the idea of a fine-proportion'd figure.</p>

<p>Having set up the Antinous as our pattern, we will
suppose there were placed on one side of it, the unwieldy
elephant-like figure of an Atlas, made up of
such thick bones and muscles, as would best fit him for
supporting a vast weight, according to his character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
extreme heavy strength. And, on the other side, imagine
the slim figure of a Mercury, every where neatly formed
for the utmost light agility, with slender bones and taper
muscles fit for his nimble bounding from the ground.&mdash;Both
these figures must be supposed of equal height,
and not exceeding six foot<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> If the scale of either of these proportions were to exceed six foot in
the life, the quality of strength in one, and agility in the other, would
gradually decrease, the larger the person grew. There are sufficient proofs
of this, both from mechanical reasonings and common observation.</p></div>

<p>Our <i>extremes</i> thus placed, now imagine the Atlas
throwing off by degrees, certain portions of bone and
muscle, proper for the attainment of light agility,
as if aiming at the Mercury's airy form and quality, whilst
on the other hand, see the Mercury augmenting his taper
figure by equal degrees, and growing towards an
Atlas in equal time, by receiving to the like places
from whence they came, the very quantities that the other
had been casting off, when, as they approach each other
in weight, their forms of course may be imagined to
grow more and more alike, till at a certain point of
time, they meet in just similitude; which being an exact
medium between the two extremes, we may thence
conclude it to be the precise form of exact proportion,
fittest for perfect active strength or graceful movement;
such as the Antinous we proposed to imitate and figure
in the mind<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The jocky who knows to an ounce what flesh or bone in a horse is
fittest for speed or strength, will as easily conceive the like process between
the strongest dray-horse and the fleetest racer, and soon conclude,
that the fine war-horse must be the medium between the two extremes.</p></div>

<p>I am apprehensive that this part of my scheme,
for explaining exact proportion, may not be thought so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
sufficiently determinate as could be wished: be this as
it will, I must submit it to the reader, as my best resource
in so difficult a case: and shall therefore beg
leave to try to illustrate it a little more, by observing,
that, in like manner, any two opposite colours in the
<i>rainbow</i>, form a third between them, by thus imparting
to each other their peculiar qualities; as for example, the brightest
yellow, and the lively blue that is placed at some distance
from it, visibly approach, and blend by interchangable
degrees, and, as above, <i>temper</i> rather than
destroy each other's vigour, till they meet in one firm
compound; whence, at a certain point, the sight of
what they were originally, is quite lost; but in their
stead, a most pleasing green is found, which colour
nature hath chose for the vestment of the earth, and
with the beauty of which the eye is never tired.</p>

<p>From the order of the ideas which the description
of the above three figures may have raised in the mind,
we may easily compose between them, various other
proportions. And as the painter, by means of a certain
order in the arrangement of the colours upon his pallet,
readily mixes up what kind of tint he pleases, so may
we mix up and compound in the imagination such fit
parts as will be consistent with this or that particular
character, or at least be able thereby to discover how
such characters are composed, when we see them either
in art or nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>But perhaps even the word <i>character, as it relates to
form,</i> may not be quite understood by every one, tho'
it is so frequently used: nor do I remember to have seen
it explained any where. Therefore on this account&mdash;and
also as it will further shew the use of thinking of
form and motion together, it will not be improper to
observe,&mdash;that notwithstanding a character, in this sense,
chiefly depends on a figure being remarkable as to its
form, either in some particular part, or altogether; yet
surely no figure, be it ever so singular, can be perfectly
conceived as a character, till we find it connected with
some remarkable circumstance or cause, for such particularity
of appearance; for instance, a fat bloted person
doth not call to mind the character of a Silenus,
till we have joined the idea of voluptuousness with it;
so likewise strength to support, and clumsiness of figure,
are united, as well in the character of an Atlas as in a
porter.</p>

<p>When we consider the great weight chairmen often
have to carry, do we not readily consent that there is a
propriety and fitness in the tuscan order of their legs,
by which they properly become <i>characters</i> as to figure?</p>

<p>Watermen too, are of a distinct cast, or character,
whose legs are no less remarkable for their smallness:
for as there is naturally the greatest call for nutriment
to the parts that are most exercised, so of course these
that lye so much stretched out, are apt to dwindle, or
not grow to their full size. There is scarcely a waterman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that rows upon the Thames, whose figure doth
not confirm this observation. Therefore were I to paint
the character of a Charon, I would thus distinguish his
make from that of a common man's; and, in spite of
the word <i>low</i>, venture to give him a broad pair of shoulders,
and spindle shanks, whether I had the authority
of an antique statue, or basso-relievo, for it or not.</p>

<p>May be, I cannot throw a stronger light on what has
been hitherto said of proportion, than by animadverting
on a remarkable beauty in the Apollo-belvedere; which
hath given it the preference even to the Antinous: I
mean a super-addition of <i>greatness</i>, to at least as much
beauty and grace, as is found in the latter.</p>

<p>These two master-pieces of art, are seen together in
the same palace at Rome, where the Antinous fills
the spectator with admiration only, whilst the Apollo
strikes him with surprise, and, as travellers express themselves,
with an appearance of something <i>more than human</i>;
which they <i>of course</i> are always at a loss to describe:
and this effect, they say, is the more astonishing,
as upon examination its disproportion is evident
even to a common eye. One of the best sculptors we
have in England, who lately went to see them, confirm'd
to me what has been now said, particularly as to the
legs and thighs being too long, and too large for the
upper parts. And Andrea Sacchi, one of the great Italian
painters, seems to have been of the same opinion, or he
would hardly have given his Apollo, crowning Pasquilini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the musician, the exact proportion of the Antinous, (in
a famous picture of his now in England) as otherwise
it seems to be a direct copy from the Apollo.</p>

<p>Although in very great works we often see an inferior
part neglected, yet here it cannot be the case, because
in a fine statue, just proportion is one of its essential
beauties: therefore it stands to reason, that these limbs
must have been lengthened on purpose, otherwise it
might easily have been avoided.</p>

<p>So that if we examine the beauties of this figure
thoroughly, we may reasonably conclude, that what
has been hitherto thought so unaccountably <i>excellent</i> in
its general appearance, hath been owing to what hath seem'd
a <i>blemish</i> in a part of it: but let us endeavour
to make this matter as clear as possible, as it may add
more force to what has been said.</p>

<p>Statues by being bigger than life, (as this is one, and
larger than the Antinous) always gain some nobleness in
effect, according to the principle of quantity<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but this
alone is not sufficient to give what is properly to be
called, <i>greatness</i> in proportion; for were figures 17 and
18, in plate I, to be drawn or carved by a scale of ten
feet high, they would still be but pigmy proportions, as,
on the other hand, a figure of but two inches, may
represent a gigantic height.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 192px;">
<img src="images/17-18.jpg" width="192" height="290" alt="17 18" />
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> See <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI</a>.</p></div>

<p>Therefore <i>greatness</i> of proportion must be considered,
as depending on the application of <i>quantity</i> to those
parts of the body where it can give more scope to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
grace in movement, as to the neck for the larger and
swan-like turns of the head, and to the legs and thighs,
for the more ample sway of all the upper parts together.</p>

<p>By which we find that the Antinous's being equally
magnified to the Apollo's height, would not sufficiently
produce that superiority of effect, as to greatness, so
evidently seen in the latter. The additions necessary to
the production of this <i>greatness</i> in proportion, as it there
appears added to grace, must then be, by the proper
application of them, to the parts mention'd only.</p>

<p>I know not how further to prove this matter than
by appealing to the reader's eye, and common observation,
as before.</p>

<p>The Antinous being allowed to have the justest proportion
possible, let us see what addition, upon the principle
of quantity, can be made to it, without taking
away any of its beauty.</p>

<p>If we imagine an addition of dimensions to the head,
we shall immediately conceive it would only deform&mdash;if
to the hands or feet, we are sensible of something gross
and ungenteel,&mdash;if to the whole lengths of the arms,
we feel they would be dangling and aukward&mdash;if by
an addition of length or breadth to the body, we know
it would appear heavy and clumsy&mdash;there remains then
only the <i>neck</i>, with the <i>legs</i> and <i>thighs</i> to speak of; but,
to these we find, that not only certain additions may
be admitted without causing any disagreeable effect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
but that thereby <i>greatness</i>, the last perfection as to proportion,
is given to the human form; as is evidently
express'd in the Apollo: and may still be further confirmed
by examining the drawings of Parmigiano, where
these particulars are seen in excess; yet on this account
his works are said, by all true connoisseurs, to have an
inexpressible greatness of taste in them, though otherwise
very incorrect.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the two general ideas we set
out with at the beginning of this chapter, and recollect
that under the first, on surface, I have shewn in what
manner, and how far human proportion is measureable,
by varying the contents of the body, conformable to the
given proportion of two lines. And that under the second
and more extensive general idea of form, as arising
from fitness for movement, &amp;c. I have endeavour'd to
explain, by every means I could devise, that every particular
and minute dimension of the body, should conform
to such purposes of movement, &amp;c. as have been
first properly considered and determined: on which conjunctively,
the true proportion of every character must
depend; and is found so to do, by our joint-sensation of
bulk and motion. Which account of the proportion of
the human body, however imperfect, may possibly stand
its ground, till one more plausible shall be given.</p>

<p>As the Apollo [Fig. 12 p. I] has been only mention'd on account
of the greatness of its proportion, I think in justice to
so fine a performance; and also as it is not foreign to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
the point we have been upon, we may subjoin an Observation
or two on its perfections.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 271px;">
<img src="images/12.jpg" width="271" height="434" alt="12" />
</div>

<p>Besides, what is commonly allow'd, if we consider it
by the rules here given for constituting or composing
character, it will discover the author's great sagacity, in
choosing a proportion for this deity, which has served
two noble purposes at once; in that these very dimensions
which appear to have given it so much dignity,
are the same that are best fitted to produce the utmost
speed. And what could characterise the god of day,
either so strongly or elegantly, to be expressive in a statue,
as superior swiftness, and beauty dignify'd? and how
poetically doth the action it is put into, carry on the
allusion to speed,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> as he is lightly stepping forward,
and seeming to shoot his arrows from him; if the arrows
may be allowed to signify the sun's rays? This at
least may as well be supposed as the common surmise,
that he is killing the dragon, Python; which certainly
is very inconsistent with so erect an attitude, and benign
an aspect<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>&mdash;&mdash;the sun: which cometh forth as a bridegroom out of his
chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his course. Psalm xix. 5.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The accounts given, in relation to this statue, make it so highly
probable that it was the great Apollo of Delphos, that, for my own part,
I make no manner of doubt of its being so.</p></div>

<p>Nor are the inferior parts neglected: the drapery also
that depends from his shoulders, and folds over his extended
arm, hath its treble office. As first, it assists in
keeping the general appearance within the boundary of
a pyramid, which being inverted, is, for a single figure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
rather more natural and genteel than one upon its basis.
Secondly, it fills up the vacant angle under the arm, and
takes off the straightness of the lines the arm necessarily
makes with the body in such an action; and, lastly,
spreading as it doth, in pleasing folds, it helps to satisfy
the eye with a noble quantity in the composition altogether,
without depriving the beholder of any part of
the beauties of the naked: in short, this figure might
serve, were a lecture to be read over it, to exemplify
every principle that hath been hitherto advanced. We
shall therefore close not only all we have to say on proportion
with it, but our whole lineal account of form,
except what we have particularly to offer as to the face;
which it will be proper to defer, till we have spoken of
<i>light</i> and <i>shade</i> and <i>colour</i>.</p>

<p>As some of the ancient statues have been of such singular
use to me, I shall beg leave to conclude this chapter
with an observation or two on them in general.</p>

<p>It is allowed by the most skilful in the imitative arts,
that tho' there are many of the remains of antiquity,
that have great excellencies about them; yet there
are not, moderately speaking, above twenty that may
be justly called <i>capital</i>. There is one reason, nevertheless,
besides the blind veneration that generally is
paid to antiquity, for holding even many very imperfect
pieces in some degree of estimation: I mean that <i>peculiar
taste of elegance</i> which so visibly runs through them
all, down to the most incorrect of their basso-relievos:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
which <i>taste</i>, I am persuaded, my reader will now conceive
to have been entirely owing to the perfect knowledge
the ancients must have had of the use of the precise
serpentine-line.</p>

<p>But this cause of <i>elegance</i> not having been since sufficiently
understood, no wonder such effects should have
appear'd mysterious, and have drawn mankind into a
sort of religious esteem, and even bigotry, to the works
of antiquity.</p>

<p>Nor have there been wanting of artful people, who
have made good profit of those whose unbounded admiration
hath run them into enthusiasm. Nay there are,
I believe, some who still carry on a comfortable trade
in such originals as have been so defaced and maimed
by time, that it would be impossible, without a pair of
<i>double-ground</i> connoisseur-spectacles, to see whether
they have ever been good or bad: they deal also
in cook'd-up copies, which they are very apt to put off
for originals. And whoever dares be bold enough to detect
such impositions, finds himself immediately branded,
and given out as one of low ideas, ignorant of the true
sublime, self-conceited, envious, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But as there are a great part of mankind that delight
most in what they least understand; for ought I know,
the emolument may be equal between the <i>bubler</i> and
the <i>bubled</i>: at least this seems to have been Butler's
opinion:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
Doubtless the pleasure is as great<br />
In being cheated, as to cheat.<br />

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Light</span> and <span class="smcap">Shade</span>, and the manner in which objects
are explained to the eye by them</i>.</h3>


<p>Although both this and the next chapter may
seem more particularly relative to the art of painting,
than any of the foregoing; yet, as hitherto, I have
endeavour'd to be understood by every reader, so here
also I shall avoid, as much as the subject will permit,
speaking of what would only be well-conceived by
painters.</p>

<p>There is such a subtile variety in the nature of appearances,
that probably we shall not be able to gain
much ground by this enquiry, unless we exert and apply
the full use of every sense, that will convey to us
any information concerning them.</p>

<p>So far as we have already gone, the sense of feeling,
as well as that of seeing, hath been apply'd to; so that
perhaps a man born blind, may, by his better touch
than is common to those who have their sight, together
with the regular process that has been here given of
lines, so feel out the nature of forms, as to make a tolerable
judgment of what is beautiful to sight.</p>

<p>Here again our other senses must assist us, notwithstanding
in this chapter we shall be more confined to
what is communicated to the eye by rays of light; and
tho' things must now be consider'd as appearances only;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
produced and made out merely by means of <i>lights,
shades,</i> and <i>colours</i>.</p>

<p>By the various circumstances of which, every one
knows we have represented on the flat surface of the
looking-glass, pictures equal to the originals reflected by
it. The painter too, by proper dispositions of lights,
shades, and colours, on his canvas, will raise the like
ideas. Even prints, by means of lights and shades alone,
will perfectly inform the eye of every shape and distance
whatsoever, in which even lines must be consider'd as
narrow parts of shade, a number of them, drawn or
engrav'd neatly side by side, called <i>hatching</i>, serve as
shades in prints, and when they are artfully managed,
are a kind of pleasing <i>succedaneum</i> to the delicacy of
nature's.</p>

<p>Could mezzo-tinto prints be wrought as accurately
as those with the graver, they would come nearest to
nature, because they are done without strokes or lines.</p>

<p>I have often thought that a landskip, in the process
of this way of representing it, doth a little resemble the
first coming on of day. The copper-plate it is done
upon, when the artist first takes it into hand, is wrought
all over with an edg'd-tool, so as to make it print one
even black, like night: and his whole work after this, is
merely introducing the lights into it; which he does by
scraping off the rough grain according to his design,
artfully smoothing it most where light is most required:
but as he proceeds in burnishing the lights, and clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
up the shades, he is obliged to take off frequent
impressions to prove the progress of the work, so that
each proof appears like the different times of a foggy
morning, till one becomes so finish'd as to be distinct
and clear enough to imitate a day-light piece. I have
given this description because I think the whole operation,
in the simplest manner, shews what lights and
shades alone will do.</p>

<p>As light must always be supposed, I need only speak
of such privations of it as are called shades or shadows,
wherein I shall endeavour to point out and regularly
describe a certain order and arrangement in their appearance,
in which order we may conceive different
kinds of softnings and modulations of the rays of light
which are said to fall upon the eye from every object it
sees, and to cause those more or less-pleasing vibrations
of the optic nerves, which serve to inform the mind
concerning every different shape or figure that presents
itself.</p>

<p>The best light for seeing the shadows of objects truly,
is, that which comes in at a common sized window,
where the sun doth not shine; I shall therefore speak
of their order as seen by this kind of light: and shall
take the liberty in the present and following chapter, to
consider colours but as variegated shades, which together
with common shades, will now be divided into
two general parts or branches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The first we shall call <span class="smcap">prime tints</span>, by which is
meant any colour or colours on the surfaces of objects;
and the use we shall make of these different hues will
be to consider them as shades to one another. Thus
gold is a shade to silver, &amp;c. exclusive of those additional
shades which may be made in any degree by the
privation of light.</p>

<p>The second branch may be called <span class="smcap">retiring shades</span>,
which gradate or go off by degrees, as figs. [84 and 85 T p. II]. These
shades, as they vary more or less, produce beauty,
whether they are occasioned by the privation of light,
or made by the pencilings of art or nature.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/84-85.jpg" width="350" height="235" alt="figs 84 and 85" />
</div>

<p>When I come to treat of colouring, I shall particularly
shew in what manner the gradating of prime tints
serve to the making a beautiful complexion; in this
place we shall only observe how nature hath by these
gradating shades ornamented the surfaces of animals;
fish generally have this kind of shade from their backs
downward; birds have their feathers enriched with it;
and many flowers, particularly the rose, shew it by the
gradually-increasing colours of their leaves.</p>

<p>The sky always gradates one way or other, and the
rising or setting sun exhibits it in great perfection, the
imitating of which was Claud. de Loraine's peculiar excellence,
and is now Mr. Lambert's: there is so much
of what is called harmony to the eye to be produced
by this shade, that I believe we may venture to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
in art it is the painter's gamut, which nature has
sweetly pointed out to us in what we call the eyes of a
peacock's tail: and the nicest needle-workers are taught
to weave it into every flower and leaf, right or wrong,
as if it was as constantly to be observed as it is seen in
flames of fire; because it is always found to entertain
the eye. There is a sort of needle-work called Irish-stitch,
done in these shades only; which pleases still,
tho' it has long been out of fashion.</p>

<p>There is so strict an analogy between shade and sound,
that they may well serve to illustrate each other's qualities:
for as sounds gradually decreasing and increasing
give the idea of progression from, or to the ear, just so
do retiring shades shew progression, by figuring it to the
eye. Thus, as by objects growing still fainter, we
judge of distances in prospects, so by the decreasing
noise of thunder, we form the idea of its moving further
from us. And with regard to their similitude in beauty,
like as the gradating shade pleases the eye, so the increasing,
or swelling note, delights the ear.</p>

<p>I have call'd it the retiring shade, because by the
successive, or continual change in its appearance, it is
equally instrumental with converging lines<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, in shewing
how much objects, or any parts of them, retire or recede
from the eye; without which, a floor, or horizontal-plane,
would often seem to stand upright like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
a wall. And notwithstanding all the other ways by
which we learn to know at what distances things
are from us, frequent deceptions happen to the eye
on account of deficiencies in this shade: for if the
light chances to be so disposed on objects as not to give
this shade its true gradating appearance, not only spaces
are confounded, but round things appear flat, and flat
ones round.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> See p. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>. The two converging lines from the ship, to the point C,
under fig. 47, plate I.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 828px;">
<img src="images/94.jpg" width="828" height="317" alt="94" />
</div>

<p>But although the retiring shade hath this property,
when seen with converging lines, yet if it describes
no particular form, as none of those do in fig. 94, on top of
plate II, it can only appear as a flat-pencil'd shade; but
being inclosed within some known boundary or out-line,
such as may signify a wall, a road, a globe, or any other
form in perspective where the parts retire, it will then
shew its retiring quality: as for example, the retiring
shade on the floor, in plate II, which gradates from the
dog's feet to those of the dancer's, shews, that by this
means a level appearance is given to the ground: so when
a cube is put into true perspective on paper, with lines
only, which do but barely hint the directions every face
of it is meant to take, these shades make them seem to
retire just as the perspective lines direct; thus mutually
compleating the idea of those recessions which neither
of them alone could do.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 593px;">
<img src="images/gradatedshadow.jpg" width="593" height="389" alt="gradated shadow" />
</div>

<p>Moreover, the out-line of a globe is but a circle on
the paper; yet, according to the manner of filling up
the space within it, with this shade, it may be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
to appear either flat, globular, or concave, in any of its
positions with the eye; and as each manner of filling
up the circle for those purposes must be very different,
it evidently shews the necessity of distinguishing this
shade into as many species or kinds, as there are classes
or species of lines, with which they may have a correspondence.</p>

<p>In doing which, it will be found, that, by their
correspondency with, and conformity to objects, either
composed of straight, curved, waving, or serpentine
lines, they of course take such appearances of variety as
are adequate to the variety made by those lines; and
by this conformity of shades we have the same ideas
of any of the objects composed of the above lines in their
front aspects, as we have of them by their profiles;
which otherwise could not be without feeling them.</p>

<p>Now instead of giving engraved examples of each
species of shade, as I have done of lines, I have found
that they may be more satisfactorily pointed out and
described by having recourse to the life.</p>

<p>But in order to the better and more precisely fixing
upon what may be there seen, as the distinct species, of
which all the shades of the retiring kind in nature partake,
in some degree or other, the following scheme is
offered, and intended as an additional means of making
such simple impressions in the mind, as may be thought
adequate to the four species of lines described in Chapter
VII. Wherein we are to suppose imperceptible degrees of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
shade gradating from one figure to another.</p>

<p>The first species to be represented by, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<br />
the second by, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<br />
and the third by, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.<br />
gradating from the dots underneath, repeated either way.</p>

<p>As the first species varies or gradates but one way, it
is therefore least ornamental, and equal only to straight
lines.</p>

<p>The second gradating contrary ways, doubling the
others variety, is consequently twice as pleasing, and
thereby equal to curved lines.</p>

<p>The third species gradating doubly contrary ways, is
thereby still more pleasing in proportion to that quadruple
variety which makes it become capable of conveying
to the mind an equivalent in shade, which expresses
the beauty of the waving line, when it cannot be
seen as a line.</p>

<p>The retiring shade, adequate to the serpentine line,
now should follow; but as the line itself could not be
expressed on paper, without the figure of a cone [Fig. 26 p. I],
so neither can this shade be described without the assistance
of a proper form, and therefore must be deferred
a little longer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;">
<img src="images/26.jpg" width="505" height="154" alt="26" />
</div>

<p>When only the ornamental quality of shades is spoken
of, for the sake of distinguishing them from retiring
shades, let them be considered as pencilings only;
whence another advantage will arise, which is, that then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
all the intervening mixtures, with their degrees of beauty
between each species, may be as easily conceived, as
those have been between each class of lines.</p>

<p>And now let us have recourse to the experiments
in life, for such examples as may explain the retiring
power of each species; since, as has been before observed,
they must be considered together with their
proper forms, or else their properties cannot be well
distinguished.</p>

<p>All the degrees of obliquity that planes, or flat surfaces
are capable of moving into, have their appearances
of recession perfected by the first species of retiring
shades, which may evidently be seen by setting opposite
a door, as it is opening outwards from the eye, and
fronting one light.</p>

<p>But it will be proper to premise, that when it is quite
shut, and flat or parallel to the eye and window, it will
have only a penciling shade gradating upon it, and
spreading all around from the middle, but which will
not have the power of giving the idea of recession any
way, as when it opens, and the lines run in perspective
to a point; because the square figure or parallel lines of
the door, do not correspond with such shade; but let a
door be circular in the same situation, and all without
side, or round about it, painted of any other colour, to
make its figure more distinctly seen, and it will immediately
appear concave like a bason, the shade continually
retiring; because this circular species of shade would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
then be accompanied by its corresponding form, a
circle<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Note, if the light were to come in at a very little hole not far
from the door, so as to make the gradation sudden and strong, like
what may be made with a small candle held near a wall or a wainscot,
the bason would appear the deeper for it.
</p>
<p>
Note also, that when planes are seen parallel to the eye in open day-light,
they have scarce any round gradating or penciling shade at all,
but appear merely as uniform prime tints, because the rays of light are
equally diffused upon them. Nevertheless, give them but obliquity,
they will more or less exhibit the retiring shade.</p></div>

<p>But to return; we observ'd that all the degrees of
obliquity in the moving of planes or flat surfaces, have
the appearances of their recession perfected to the eye
by the first species of retiring shade. For example, then;
when the door opens, and goes from its parallel situation
with the eye, the shade last spoken of, may be observed
to alter and change its round gradating appearance,
into that of gradating one way only; as when a
standing water takes a current upon the least power
given it to descend.</p>

<p>Note, if the light should come in at the door-way, instead
of the window, the gradation then would be reversed
but still the effect of recession would be just the
same, as this shade ever complies with the perspective
lines.</p>

<p>In the next place, let us observe the <i>ovolo</i>, or quarter-round
in a cornice, fronting the eye in like manner, by
which may be seen an example of the second species;
where, on its most projecting part, a line of light is
seen, from whence these shades retire contrary ways,
by which the curvature is understood.</p>

<p>And, perhaps, in the very same cornice may be seen an
example of the third species, in that ornamental member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
called by the architects <i>cyma recta</i>, or talon, which
indeed is no more than a larger sort of waving or ogee
moulding; wherein, by the convex parts gently gliding
into the concave, you may see four contrasted gradating
shades, shewing so many varied recessions from the
eye; by which we are made as sensible of its waving
form as if we saw the profile out-line of some corner of
it, where it is miter'd, as the joiners term it. Note,
when these objects have a little gloss on them these appearances
are most distinct.</p>

<p>Lastly, the serpentine shade may be seen (light and
situation as before) by the help of the following figure,
as thus; imagine the horn, figure 57, plate II, to be of
so soft a nature, that with the fingers only, it might be
pressed into any shape; then beginning gently from the
middle of the dotted line, but pressing harder and harder
all the way up the lesser end, by such pressure there
would be as much concave above, as would remain
convex below, which would bring it equal in variety or
beauty to the ogee moulding; but after this, by giving
the whole a twist, like figure 58, these shades must unavoidably
change their appearances, and in some measure,
twist about as the concave and convex parts
are twisted, and consequently thereby add that variety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
which of course will give this species of shade, as much
the preference to the foregoing, as forms composed of
serpentine lines have, to those composed only of the
waving. See <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/57-58.jpg" width="400" height="210" alt="figs 57 and 58" />
</div>

<p>I should not have given my reader the trouble of
compleating, by the help of his imagination, the foregoing
figure, but as it may contribute to the more ready
and particular conception of that intricate variety which
twisted figures give to this species of shade, and to facilitate
his understanding the cause of its beauty, wherever
it may be seen on surfaces of ornament, when it will be
found no where more conspicuous than in a fine face,
as will be seen upon further enquiry.</p>

<p>The dotted line [Fig. 97 B p. I], which begins from the concave
part, under the arch of the brow, near the nose, and from
thence winding down by the corner of the eye, and there
turning obliquely with the round of the cheek, shews
the course of that twist of shades in a face, which was
before described by the horn; and which may be most
perfectly seen in the life, or in a marble busto, together
with the following additional circumstances still remaining
to be described.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/97.jpg" width="266" height="272" alt="97" />
</div>

<p>As a face is for the most part round, it is therefore
apt to receive reflected light on its shadowy side<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
not only adds more beauty by another pleasing tender
gradation, but also serves to distinguish the roundness
of the cheeks, &amp;c. from such parts as sink and fall in:
because concavities do not admit of reflections, as convex
forms do<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Note, though I have advised the observing objects by a front light,
for the sake of the better distinguishing our four fundamental species of shades,
yet objects in general are more advantagiously, and agreeably seen
by light coming side-ways upon them, and therefore generally chose
in paintings; as it gives an additional reflected softness, not unlike the
gentle tone of an echo in music.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> As an instance that convex and concave would appear the same, if
the former were to have no reflection thrown upon, observe the ovolo and
cavetto, or channel, in a cornice, placed near together, and seen by a
front light, when they will each of them, by turns, appear either concave,
or convex, as fancy shall direct.</p></div>

<p>I have now only to add, that as before observed,
Chapter IV, page <a href="#Page_23">23</a>, that the oval hath a noble simplicity
in it, more equal to its variety than any other object
in nature; and of which the general form of a face is
composed; therefore, from what has been now shewn,
the general gradation-shade belonging to it, must consequently
be adequate thereto, and which evidently
gives a delicate softness to the whole composition of a
face; insomuch that every little dent, crack, or scratch,
the form receives, its shadows also suffer with it, and
help to shew the blemish. Even the least roughness
interrupts and damages that soft gradating play of
shades which fall upon it. Mr. Dryden, describing the
light and shades of a face, in his epistle to Sir Godfrey
Kneller the portrait painter, seems, by the penetration
of his incomparable genius, to have understood that
language in the works of nature, which the latter, by
means of an exact eye and a strict obeying hand, could
only faithfully transcribe; when he says,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
Where light to shades descending, plays, not strives,<br />
Dies by degrees, and by degrees revives.<br />

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Composition</span> with regard to <span class="smcap">Light, Shade</span>
and <span class="smcap">Colours</span></i>.</h3>


<p>Under this head I shall attempt shewing what it
is that gives the appearance of that hollow or
vacant space in which all things move so freely; and in
what manner light, shade and colours, mark or point
out the distances of one object from another, and occasion
an agreeable play upon the eye, called by the
painters a fine keeping, and pleasing composition of
light and shade. Herein my design is to consider this
matter as a performance of nature <i>without</i>, or before
the eye; I mean, as if the objects with their shades, &amp;c.
were in fact circumstanced as they appear, and as the
unskill'd in optics take them to be. And let it be remarked
throughout this chapter, that the pleasure arising
from composition, as in a fine landskip, &amp;c. is chiefly
owing to the dispositions and assemblages of light and
shades, which are so order'd by the principles called
<span class="smcap">opposition, breadth</span> and <span class="smcap">simplicity</span>, as to produce
a just and distinct perception of the objects before us.</p>

<p>Experience teaches us that the eye may be subdued
and forced into forming and disposing of objects even
quite contrary to what it would naturally see them, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the prejudgment of the mind from the better authority
of feeling, or some other persuasive motive. But
surely this extraordinary perversion of the sight would
not have been suffer'd, did it not tend to great and necessary
purposes, in rectifying some deficiencies which it
would otherwise be subject to (tho' we must own at the
same time, that the mind itself may be so imposed
upon as to make the eye see falsely as well as truly) for
example, were it not for this controul over the sight,
it is well known, that we should not only see things
double, but upside down, as they are painted upon the
retina, and as each eye has a distinct sight. And then
as to distances; a fly upon a pane of glass is sometimes
imagined a crow, or larger bird afar off, till some circumstance
hath rectified the mistake, and convinced us
of its real size and place.</p>

<p>Hence I would infer, that the eye generally gives its
assent to such space and distances as have been first
measured by the feeling, or otherwise calculated in
the mind: which measurements and calculations are
equally, if not more, in the power of a blind man, as
was fully experienced by that incomparable mathematician
and wonder of his age, the late professor Sanderson.</p>

<p>By pursuing this observation on the faculties of the
mind, an idea may be formed of the means by which
we attain to the perception or appearance of an immense
space surrounding us; which cavity, being subject
to divisions and subdivisions in the mind, is afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
fashioned by the limited power of the eye, first into a
hemisphere, and then into the appearance of different
distances, which are pictured to it by means of such dispositions
of light and shade as shall next be described.
And these I now desire may be looked upon, but as so
many <i>marks</i> or <i>types</i> set upon these distances, and
which are remember'd and learnt by degrees, and when
learnt, are recurred to upon all occasions.</p>

<p>If permitted then to consider light and shades as
<i>types of distinction</i>, they become, as it were, our materials,
of which <i>prime tints</i> are the principal; by these,
I mean the fixed and permanent colours of each object,
as the green of trees, &amp;c. which serve the purposes of
separating and relieving the several objects by the different
strengths or shades of them being opposed to each
other [Fig. 86 T p. II].</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 222px;">
<img src="images/86.jpg" width="222" height="357" alt="86" />
</div>

<p>The other shades that have been before spoken of,
serve and help to the like purposes when properly opposed;
but as in nature they are continually fleeting and
changing their appearances, either by our or their situations,
they sometimes oppose and relieve, and sometimes
not, as for instance; I once observed the tower-part of
a steeple so exactly the colour of a light cloud behind
it, that, at the distance I stood, there was not the least
distinction to be made, so that the spire (of a lead-colour)
seemed suspended in the air; but had a cloud of
the like tint with the steeple, supplied the place of the
white one, the tower would then have been relieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
and distinct, when the spire would have been lost to
the view.</p>

<p>Nor is it sufficient that objects are of different colours
or shades, to shew their distances from the eye, if
one does not in part hide or lay over the other, as in
fig. 86.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">
<img src="images/90.jpg" width="433" height="363" alt="90" />
</div>

<p>For as fig. [90 T p. II] the two equal balls, tho' one were black
and the other white, placed on the separate walls, supposed
distant from each other twenty or thirty feet, nevertheless,
may seem both to rest upon one, if the tops
of the walls are level with the eye; but when one ball
hides part of the other, as in the same figure, we begin
to apprehend they are upon different walls, which is
determin'd by the perspective<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>: hence you will see the
reason, why the steeple of Bloomsbury-church, in coming
from Hampstead, seems to stand upon Montague-house,
tho' it is several hundred yards distant from it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The knowledge of perspective is no small help to the seeing objects
truly, for which purpose Dr. Brook Taylor's Linear perspective made
easy to those who are unacquainted with geometry, proposed to be publish'd
soon by Mr. Kirby of Ipswich, may be of most service.</p></div>

<p>Since then the opposition of one prime tint or shade
to another, hath so great a share in marking out the recessions,
or distances in a prospect, by which the eye is
led onward step by step, it becomes a principle of consequence
enough to be further discussed, with regard to
the management of it in compositions of nature, as well
as art. As to the management of it, when seen only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
from one point, the artist hath the advantage over nature,
because such fix'd dispositions of shades as he hath
artfully put together, cannot be displaced by the alteration
of light, for which reason, designs done in two
prime tints only, will sufficiently represent all those recessions,
and give a just keeping to the representation
of a prospect, in a print; whereas, the oppositions in
nature, depending, as has been before hinted, on accidental
situations and uncertain incidents, do not always
make such pleasing composition, and would therefore
have been very often deficient, had nature worked in
two colours only; for which reason she hath provided
an infinite number of materials, not only by way of
prevention, but to add lustre and beauty to her works.</p>

<p>By an infinite number of materials, I mean colours
and shades of all kinds and degrees; some notion of
which variety may be formed by supposing a piece of
white silk by several dippings gradually dyed to a
black; and carrying it in like manner through the
prime tints of yellow, red, and blue; and then again,
by making the like progress through all the mixtures
that are to be made of these three original colours. So
that when we survey this infinite and immense variety,
it is no wonder, that, let the light or objects be situated
or changed how they will, oppositions seldom miss; nor
that even every incident of shade should sometimes be
so completely disposed as to admit of no further beauty,
as to composition; and from whence the artist hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
by observation taken his principles of imitation, as in
the following respect.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 443px;">
<img src="images/89.jpg" width="443" height="315" alt="89" />
</div>

<p>Those objects which are intended most to affect the
eye, and come forwardest to the view, must have large,
strong, and smart oppositions, like the fore-ground in
fig. [89 p. II], and what are designed to be thrown further off,
must be made still weaker and weaker, as expressed in
figures 86, 92, and 93, which receding in order make a kind of
gradation of oppositions; to which, and all the other
circumstances already described, both for recession, and
beauty, nature hath added what is known by the name
of aerial perspective; being that interposition of air,
which throws a general soft retiring tint over the whole
prospect; to be seen in excess at the rising of a fog.
All which again receives still more distinctness, as well
as a greater degree of variety, when the sun shines
bright, and casts broad shadows of one object upon
another; which gives the skilful designer such hints for
shewing broad and fine oppositions of shades, as give
life and spirit to his performances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Breadth</span> of <span class="smcap">shade</span> is a principle that assists in
making distinction more conspicuous; thus fig. [87 p. I], is
better distinguish'd by its breadth or quantity of shade,
and view'd with more ease and pleasure at any distance,
than fig. [88 p. I], which hath many, and these but narrow
shades between the folds. And for one of the noblest
instances of this, let Windsor-castle be viewed at the
rising or setting of the sun.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 211px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Let breadth be introduced how it will, it always
gives great repose to the eye; as on the contrary, when
lights and shades in a composition are scattered about
in little spots, the eye is constantly disturbed, and the
mind is uneasy, especially if you are eager to understand
every object in the composition, as it is painful
to the ear when any one is anxious to know what is
said in company, where many are talking at the same
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Simplicity</span> (which I am last to speak of) in the disposition
of a great variety, is best accomplished by following
nature's constant rule, of dividing composition
into three or five parts, or parcels, see <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chapter IV</a> on simplicity:
the painters accordingly divide theirs into fore-ground,
middle-ground, and distance or back-ground;
which simple and distinct quantities <i>mass</i> together that
variety which entertains the eye; as the different parts
of base, tenor, and treble, in a composition in music,
entertain the ear.</p>

<p>Let these principles be reversed, or neglected, the
the light and shade will appear as disagreeable as fig. [91 T p. II], whereas,
was this to be a composition of lights and shades only,
properly disposed, tho' ranged under no particular figures,
it might still have the pleasing effect of a picture.
And here, as it would be endless to enter upon the different
effects of lights and shades on lucid and transparent
bodies, we shall leave them to the reader's observation,
and so conclude this chapter.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Colouring</span></i>.</h3>


<p>By the beauty of colouring, the painters mean that
disposition of colours on objects, together with their
proper shades, which appear at the same time both
distinctly varied and artfully united, in compositions of
any kind; but, by way of pre-eminence, it is generally
understood of flesh-colour, when no other composition
is named.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, and having already said enough
of retiring shades, I shall now only describe the nature
and effect of the prime tint of flesh; for the composition
of this, when rightly understood, comprehends
every thing that can be said of the colouring of all other
objects whatever.</p>

<p>And herein (as has been shewn in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII</a>, of the
manner of composing pleasing forms) the whole process
will depend upon the art of varying; i. e. upon an artful
manner of varying every colour belonging to flesh,
under the direction of the six fundamental principles
there spoken of.</p>

<p>But before we proceed to shew in what manner
these principles conduce to this design, we shall take a
view of nature's curious ways of producing all sorts of
complexions, which may help to further our conception
of the principles of varying colours, so as to see why
they cause the effect of beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well known, the fair young girl, the brown
old man, and the negro; nay, all mankind, have the
same appearance, and are alike disagreeable to the eye,
when the upper skin is taken away: now to conceal so
disagreeable an object, and to produce that variety of
complexions seen in the world, nature hath contrived a
transparent skin, called the cuticula, with a lining to it
of a very extraordinary kind, called the cutis; both
which are so thin any little scald will make them blister
and peel off. These adhering skins are more or less
transparent in some parts of the body than in others,
and likewise different in different persons. The cuticula
alone is like gold-beaters-skin, a little wet, but
somewhat thinner, especially in fair young people,
which would shew the fat, lean, and all the blood-vessels,
just as they lie under it, as through Isinglass,
were it not for its lining the cutis, which is so curiously
constructed, as to exhibit those things beneath it which
are necessary to life and motion, in pleasing arrangements
and dispositions of beauty.</p>

<p>The cutis is composed of tender threads like network,
fill'd with different colour'd juices. The white
juice serves to make the very fair complexion;&mdash;yellow,
makes the brunnet;&mdash;brownish yellow, the ruddy
brown;&mdash;green yellow, the olive;&mdash;dark brown, the
mulatto;&mdash;black, the negro;&mdash;These different colour'd
juices, together with the different <i>meshes</i> of the network,
and the size of its threads in this or that part, causes the
variety of complexions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>A description of this manner of its shewing the rosy
colour of the cheek, and, in like manner, the bluish
tints about the temple, &amp;c. see in the profile [fig. 95 T p. II], where
you are to suppose the black strokes of the print to be
the white threads of the network, and where the strokes
are thickest, and the part blackest, you are to suppose
the flesh would be whitest; so that the lighter part of
it stands for the vermilion-colour of the cheek, gradating
every way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/95.jpg" width="447" height="359" alt="95" />
</div>

<p>Some persons have the network so equally wove over
the whole body, face and all, that the greatest heat or
cold will hardly make them change their colour; and
these are seldom seen to blush, tho' ever so bashful,
whilst the texture is so fine in some young women, that
they redden, or turn pale, on the least occasion.</p>

<p>I am apt to think the texture of this network is of
a very tender kind, subject to damage many ways, but
able to recover itself again, especially in youth. The
fair fat healthy child of 3 or 4 years old hath it in
great perfection; most visible when it is moderately
warm, but till that age somewhat imperfect.</p>

<p>It is in this manner, then, that nature seems to do
her work.&mdash;And now let us see how by art the like
appearance may be made and penciled on the surface
of a uniform coloured statue of wax or marble; by
describing which operation we shall still more particularly
point out what is to our present purpose: I mean
the reason why the order nature hath thus made use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
should strike us with the idea of beauty; which by the
way, perhaps may be of more use to some painters than
they will care to own.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 828px;">
<img src="images/94.jpg" width="828" height="317" alt="94" />
</div>

<p>There are but three original colours in painting besides
black and white, viz. red, yellow and blue.
Green, and purple, are compounded; the first of blue and
yellow, the latter of red and blue: however these compounds
being so distinctly different from the original
colours, we will rank them as such. Fig. [94 T p. II], represents
mixt up, as on a painter's pallet, scales of these five original
colours divided into seven classes&mdash;1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7.&mdash;4, is the medium, and most brillant class, being
that which will appear a firm red, when those of 5, 6,
7, would deviate into white, and those of 1, 2, 3,
would sink into black, either by twilight or at a moderate
distance from the eye, which shews 4 to be
brightest, and a more permanent colour than the rest.
But as white is nearest to light it may be said to be
equal if not superior in value as to beauty, with class 4.
Therefore the classes 5, 6, 7, have also, almost equal
beauty with it too, because what they lose of their brillancy
and permanency of colour, they gain from the
white or light; whereas 3, 2, 1, absolutely lose their
beauty by degrees as they approach nearer to black, the
representative of darkness.</p>

<p>Let us then, for distinction and pre-eminence sake,
call class 4 of each colour, <i>bloom tints</i>, or if you please,
virgin tints, as the painters call them; and once more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
recollect, that in the disposition of colours as well as of
forms, variety, simplicity, distinctness, intricacy, uniformity
and quantity, direct in giving beauty to the colouring
of the human frame, especially if we include
the face, where uniformity and strong opposition of tints
are required, as in the eyes and mouth, which call most
for our attention. But for the general hue of flesh
now to be described, variety, intricacy and simplicity,
are chiefly required.</p>

<p>The value of the degrees of colour being thus consider'd
and ranged in order upon the pallet, figure 94,
let us next apply them to a busto, fig. [96 R p. II], of white
marble, which may be supposed to let every tint sink
into it, like as a drop of ink sinks in and spreads itself
upon course paper, whereby each tint will gradate all
around.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/96.jpg" width="212" height="240" alt="96" />
</div>

<p>If you would have the neck of the busto tinged of a
very florid and lively complexion, the pencil must be
dipt in the bloom tints of each colour as they stand one
above another at No. 4.&mdash;if for a less florid, in those of
No. 5&mdash;if for a very fair, from No. 6&mdash;and so on till
the marble would scarce be ting'd at all: let therefore
No. 6, be our present choice, and begin with penciling
on the red, as at r, the yellow tint at y, the blue tint at
b, and the purple or lake tint at p.</p>

<p>These four tints thus laid on, proceed to covering the
whole neck and breast, but still changing and varying
the situations of the tints with one another, also causing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
their shapes and sizes to differ as much as possible; red
must be oftenest repeated, yellow next often, purple
red next, and blue but seldom, except in particular parts
as the temples, backs of the hands, &amp;c. where the larger
veins shew their branching shapes (sometimes too distinctly)
still varying those appearances. But there are
no doubt infinite variations in nature, from what may
be called the most beautiful order and disposition of the
colours in flesh, not only in different persons, but in
different parts of the same, all subject to the same principles
in some degree or other.</p>

<p>Now if we imagine this whole process to be made
with the tender tints of class 7, as they are supposed to
stand, red, yellow, blue, green and purple, underneath
each other; the general hue of the performance will be
a seeming uniform prime tint, at any little distance, that
is a very fair, transparent and pearl-like complexion;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
but never quite uniform as snow, ivory, marble or wax,
like a poet's mistress, for either of these in living-flesh,
would in truth be hideous.</p>

<p>As in nature, by the general yellowish hue of the
cuticula, the gradating of one colour into another appears
to be more delicately soften'd and united together;
so will the colours we are supposed to have been
laying upon the busto, appear to be more united and
mellowed by the oils they are ground in, which takes
a yellowish cast after a little time, but is apt to do more
mischief hereby than good; for which reason care is
taken to procure such oil as is clearest, and will best
keep its colour<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in oil painting.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Notwithstanding the deep-rooted notion, even among the majority
of painters themselves, that time is a great improver of good pictures, I
will undertake to shew, that nothing can be more absurd. Having mention'd
above the whole effect of the oil, let us now see in what manner
time operates on colours themselves; in order to discover if any
changes in them can give a picture more union and harmony than has
been in the power of a skilful master, with all his rules of art, to do.
When colours change at all it must be somewhat in the manner following,
for as they are made some of metal, some of earth, some of stone, and
others of more perishable materials, time cannot operate on them otherwise
than as by daily experience we find it doth, which is, that one
changes darker, another lighter, one quite to a different colour, whilst
another, as ultramarine, will keep its natural brightness even in the fire.
Therefore how is it possible that such different materials, ever variously
changing (visibly after a certain time) should accidentally coincide with
the artist's intention, and bring about the greater harmony of the piece,
when it is manifestly contrary to their nature, for do we not see in most
collections that much time disunites, untunes, blackens, and by degrees
destroys even the best preserved pictures.
</p>
<p>
But if for argument sake we suppose, that the colours were to fall
equally together, let us see what advantage this would give to any sort
of composition. We will begin with a flower-piece: when a master hath
painted a rose, a lily, an african, a gentianella, or violet, with his best
art, and brightest colours, how far short do they fall of the freshness and
rich brillancy of nature; and shall we wish to see them fall still lower,
more faint, sullied, and dirtied by the hand of time, and then admire
them as having gained an additional beauty, and call them mended and
heightened, rather than fouled, and in a manner destroy'd; how absurd!
Instead of mellow and softened therefore, always read yellow and sullied,
for this is doing time the destroyer, but common justice. Or shall we
desire to see complexions, which in life are often, literally, as brillant as the
flowers above-mention'd, served in the like ungrateful manner. In a
landskip, will the water be more transparent, or the sky shine with a greater
lustre when embrown'd and darken'd by decay? surely no. I own it
would be a pity that Mr. Addison's beautiful description of time at
work in the gallery of pictures, and the following lines of Mr. Dryden,
should want a sufficient foundation;&mdash;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
For time shall with his ready pencil stand,<br />
Retouch your figures with his ripening hand;<br />
Mellow your colours, and imbrown the tint;<br />
Add every grace which time alone can grant;<br />
To future ages shall your fame convey,<br />
And give more beauties than he takes away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dryden to Kneller.<br />
</p>

<p>
were it not that the error they are built upon, hath been a continual blight
to the growth of the art, by misguiding both the proficient, and the encourager;
and often compelling the former, contrary to his judgment, to
imitate the damaged hue of decayed pictures; so that when his works undergo
the like injuries, they must have a double remove from nature;
which puts it in the power of the meanest observer to see his deficiencies.
Whence another absurd notion hath taken rise, viz. that the colours now-a-days
do not stand so well as formerly; whereas colours well prepared,
in which there is but little art or expence, have, and will always have,
the same properties in every age, and without accidents, as damps, bad
varnish, and the like (being laid separate and pure,) will stand and keep
together for many years in defiance of time itself.
</p>
<p>
In proof of this, let any one take a view of the cieling at Greenwich-hospital,
painted by Sir James Thornhil, forty years ago, which still
remains fresh, strong and clear as if it had been finished but yesterday:
and altho' several french writers have so learnedly, and philosophically
proved, that the air of this island is too thick, or&mdash;too something, for
the genius of a painter; yet France in all her palaces can hardly boast of
a nobler, more judicious, or richer performance of its kind. Note, the
upper end of the hall where the royal family is painted, was left chiefly
to the pencil of Mr. Andrea a foreigner, after the payment originally
agreed upon for the work was so much reduced, as made it not worth
Sir James's while to finish the whole with his own more masterly hand.</p></div>

<p>Upon the whole of this account we find, that the utmost
beauty of colouring depends on the great principle of
varying by all the means of varying, and on the proper
and artful union of that variety; which may be farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
proved by supposing the rules here laid down, all or
any part of them reversed.</p>

<p>I am apt to believe, that the not knowing nature's
artful, and intricate method of uniting colours for the
production of the variegated composition, or prime tint of
flesh, hath made colouring, in the art of painting, a kind
of mystery in all ages; insomuch, that it may fairly be
said, out of the many thousands who have labour'd to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
attain it, not above ten or twelve painters have happily
succeeded therein, Corregio (who lived in a country-village,
and had nothing but the life to study after) is
said almost to have stood alone for this particular excellence.
Guido, who made beauty his chief aim, was
always at a loss about it. Poussin scarce ever obtained
a glimpse of it, as is manifest by his many different attempts:
indeed France hath not produced one remarkably
good colourist<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The lame excuse writers on painting have made for the many great
masters that have fail'd in this particular, is, that they purposely
deaden'd their colours, and kept them, what they affectedly call'd <i>chaste</i>,
that the correctness of their outlines might be seen to greater advantage.
Whereas colours cannot be too brillant if properly disposed, because the
distinction of the parts are thereby made more perfect; as may be seen
by comparing a marble busto with the variegated colours of the face
either in the life, or well painted: it is true, uncomposed variety,
either in the features or the limbs, as being daubed with many, or one
colour, will so confound the parts as to render them unintelligible.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Rubens boldly, and in a masterly manner, kept his
bloom tints bright, separate, and distinct, but sometimes
too much so for easel or cabinet pictures; however,
his manner was admirably well calculated for great
works, to be seen at a considerable distance, such as his
celebrated cieling at Whitehall-chapel<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>: which upon a
nearer view, will illustrate what I have advanc'd with
regard to the separate brightness of the tints; and
shew, what indeed is known to every painter, that had
the colours there seen so bright and separate, been all
smooth'd and absolutely blended together, they would
have produced a dirty grey instead of flesh-colour.
The difficulty then lies in bringing <i>blue</i> the third original
colour, into flesh, on account of the vast variety
introduced thereby; and this omitted, all the difficulty
ceases; and a common sign-painter that lays his colours
smooth, instantly becomes, in point of colouring, a
Rubens, a Titian, or a Corregio.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of the <span class="smcap">Face</span></i>.</h3>


<p>Having thus spoken briefly of light, shade, and
colour, we now return to our lineal account of
form, as proposed (page <a href="#Page_91">91</a>) with regard to the face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
It is an observation, that, out of the great number of
faces that have been form'd since the creation of the
world, no two have been so exactly alike, but that the
usual and common discernment of the eye would discover
a difference between them: therefore it is not
unreasonable to suppose, that this discernment is still
capable of further improvements by instructions from a
methodical enquiry; which the ingenious Mr. Richardson,
in his treatise on painting, terms <i>the art of seeing</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/97.jpg" width="266" height="272" alt="97" />
</div>

<p>1. I shall begin with a description of such lines as
compose the features of a face of the highest taste, and
the reverse. See fig. [97, B p. I], taken from an antique head,
which stands in the first rank of estimation: in proof
of this, Raphael Urbin, and other great painters and
sculptors, have imitated it for the characters of their
heroes and other great men; and the old man's head,
fig. [98, L p. I] was model'd in clay, by Fiamingo (and not inferior
in its taste of lines, to the best antique) for the use
of Andrea Sacchi, after which model he painted all the
heads in his famous picture of St. Romoaldo's dream;
and this picture hath the reputation of being one of the
best pictures in the world<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Note, I must refer the reader to the casts of both these pieces of
sculpture, which are to be found in the hands of the curious; because
it is impossible to express all that I intend, with sufficient accuracy, in a
print of this size, whatever pains might have been taken with it; or indeed
in any print were it ever so large.</p></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 239px;">
<img src="images/98.jpg" width="239" height="351" alt="98" />
</div>

<p>These examples are here chosen to exemplify and
confirm the force of serpentine lines in a face; and let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
it also be observed, that in these master-pieces of art,
all the parts are otherwise consistent with the rules heretofore
laid down: I shall therefore only shew the effects
and use of the line of beauty. One way of proving
in what manner the serpentine line appears to operate
in this respect, may be by pressing several pieces of wire
close up and down the different parts of the face and
features of those casts; which wires will all come off so
many serpentine lines, as is partly marked in figure 97,
by the dotted lines. The beard and hair of the head,
fig. 98, being a set of loose lines naturally, and therefore
disposable at the painter's or sculptor's pleasure,
are remarkably composed in this head of nothing else
but a varied play of serpentine lines, twisting together
in a flame-like manner.</p>

<p>But as imperfections are easier to be imitated than
perfections, we shall now have it in our power to explain
the latter more fully; by shewing the reverse in
several degrees, down to the most contemptible meanness
that lines can be form'd into.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 740px;">
<img src="images/99-105.jpg" width="740" height="115" alt="99 to 105" />
</div>

<p>Figure 99, is the first degree of deviation from figure
97; where the lines are made straighter, and reduced
in quantity; deviating still more in figure 100, more
yet in figure 101, and yet more visibly in 102; figure
103, still more so; figure 104 is totally divested of all
lines of elegance, like a barber's block; and 105 is
composed merely of such plain lines as children make,
when of themselves they begin to imitate in drawing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
human face. It is evident, the inimitable Butler was
sensible of the mean and ridiculous effect of such kind
of lines, by the description he gives of the shape of
Hudibras's beard, fig. [106 L p. I],</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
In cut and dye so like a tile,<br />
A sudden view it would beguile.<br />
</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/106.jpg" width="233" height="305" alt="106" />
</div>

<p>2. With regard to character and expression; we have
daily many instances which confirm the common received
opinion, that the face is the index of the mind;
and this maxim is so rooted in us, we can scarce help
(if our attention is a little raised) forming some particular
conception of the person's mind whose face we are
observing, even before we receive information by any
other means. How often is it said, on the slightest
view, that such a one looks like a good-natur'd man,
that he hath an honest open countenance, or looks like
a cunning rogue; a man of sense, or a fool, &amp;c. And
how are our eyes riveted to the aspects of kings and
heroes, murderers and saints; and as we contemplate
their deeds, seldom fail making application to their
looks. It is reasonable to believe that aspect to be a
true and legible representation of the mind, which gives
everyone the same idea at first sight; and is afterwards
confirm'd in fact: for instance, all concur in the same
opinion, at first sight, of a down-right idiot.</p>

<p>There is but little to be seen by childrens faces, more
than that they are heavy or lively; and scarcely that
unless they are in motion. Very handsom faces of almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
any age, will hide a foolish or a wicked mind till
they betray themselves by their actions or their words:
yet the frequent aukward movements of the muscles of
the fool's face, tho' ever so handsom, is apt in time to
leave such traces up and down it, as will distinguish a
defect of mind upon examination: but the bad man,
if he be a hypocrite, may so manage his muscles, by
teaching them to contradict his heart, that little of his
mind can be gather'd from his countenance, so that the
character of an hypocrite is entirely out of the power of
the pencil, without some adjoining circumstance to discover
him, as smiling and stabbing at the same time, or
the like.</p>

<p>It is by the natural and unaffected movements of the
muscles, caused by the passions of the mind, that every
man's character would in some measure be written in
his face, by the time he arrives at forty years of age,
were it not for certain accidents which often, tho' not
always prevent it. For the ill-natur'd man, by frequently
frowning, and pouting out the muscles of his mouth,
doth in time bring those parts to a constant state of the
appearance of ill-nature, which might have been prevented
by the constant affectation of a smile; and so of
the other passions: tho' there are some that do not
affect the muscles at all simply of themselves, as love
and hope.</p>

<p>But least I should be thought to lay too great a stress
on outward shew, like a physiognomist, take this with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
you, that it is acknowledg'd there are so many different
causes which produce the same kind of movements and
appearances of the features, and so many thwartings
by accidental shapes in the make of faces, that the old
adage, fronti nulla fides, will ever stand its ground upon
the whole; and for very wise reasons nature hath thought
fit it should. But, on the other hand, as in many particular
cases, we receive information from the expressions
of the countenance, what follows is meant to give a
lineal description of the language written therein.</p>

<p>It may not be amiss just to look over the passions of
the mind, from tranquillity to extreme despair; as they
are in order described in the common drawing-book,
called, Le Brun's passions of the mind; selected from
that great master's works for the use of learners; where
you may have a compendious view of all the common
expressions at once. And altho' these are but imperfect
copies, they will answer our purpose in this place better
than any other thing I can refer you to; because the
passions are there ranged in succession, and distinctly
marked with lines only, the shadows being omitted.</p>

<p>Some features are formed so as to make this or that
expression of a passion more or less legible; for example,
the little narrow chinese eye suits a loving or laughing
expression best, as a large full eye doth those of fierceness
and astonishment; and round-rising muscles will
appear with some degree of chearfulness even in sorrow:
the features thus suiting with the expressions that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
been often repeated in the face, at length mark it with
such lines as sufficiently distinguish the character of
the mind.</p>

<p>The ancients in their lowest characters have shewn
as much judgment, and as great a degree of taste in the
management and twisting of the lines of them, as in
their statues of a sublimer kind; in the former varying
only from the precise line of grace in some parts where
the character or action required it. The dying gladiator
and the dancing fawn, the former a slave, the latter a
wild clown, are sculptored in as high a taste of lines as
the Antinous or the Apollo; with this difference, that the
precise line of grace abounds more in the two last: notwithstanding
which it is generally allow'd there is equal
merit in the former, as there is near as much judgment
required for the execution of them. Human nature can
hardly be represented more debased than in the character
of the Silenus, fig. [107 p. I], where the bulging-line figure 49,
No. 7, runs through all the features of the face, as well
as the other parts of his swinish body: whereas in the
satyr of the wood, tho' the ancients have joined the
brute with the man, we still see preserved an elegant
display of serpentine lines, that make it a graceful figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">
<img src="images/107-49.jpg" width="582" height="261" alt="figs 107 and 49" />
</div>

<p>Indeed the works of art have need of the whole advantage
of this line to make up for its other deficiencies:
for tho' in nature's works the line of beauty is often
neglected, or mixt with plain lines, yet so far are they
from being defective on this account, that by this means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
there is exhibited that infinite variety of human forms
which always distinguishes the hand of nature from the
limited and insufficient one of art; and as thus she for
the sake of variety upon the whole, deviates sometimes
into plain and inelegant lines, if the poor artist is but
able now and then to correct and give a better taste to
some particular part of what he imitates, by having
learnt so to do from her more perfect works, or copying
from those that have, ten to one he grows vain upon it,
and fancies himself a nature-mender; not considering,
that even in these, the meanest of her works, she is
never wholly destitute of such lines of beauty and other
delicacies, as are not only beyond his narrow reach, but
are seen wanting even in the most celebrated attempts
to rival her. But to return,</p>

<p>As to what we call plain lines, there is this remarkable
effect constantly produced by them, that being
more or less conspicuous in any kind of character or expression
of the face, they bring along with them certain
degrees of a foolish or ridiculous aspect.</p>

<p>It is the inelegance of these lines which more properly
belonging to inanimate bodies, and being seen
where lines of more beauty and taste are expected, that
renders the face silly and ridiculous. See Chapter VI, p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>.</p>

<p>Children in infancy have movements in the muscles
of their faces peculiar to their age, as an uninformed
and unmeaning stare, an open mouth, and simple grin:
all which expressions are chiefly formed of plain curves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and these movements and expressions ideots are apt to
retain; so that in time they mark their faces with these
uncouth lines; and when the lines coincide and agree
with the natural forms of the features, it becomes a
more apparent and confirmed character of an ideot.
These plain shapes last mentioned, sometimes happen
to people of the best sense, to some when the features
are at rest, to others when they are put into motion;
which a variety of constant regular movements proceeding
from a good understanding, and fashioned by a
genteel education, will often by degrees correct into
lines of more elegance.</p>

<p>That particular expression likewise of the face, or
movement of a feature which becomes one person, shall
be disagreeable in another, just as such expressions or
turns chance to fall in with lines of beauty, or the reverse;
for this reason there are pretty frowns and disagreeable
smiles: the lines that form a pleasing smile
about the corners of the mouth have gentle windings,
as fig. [108 L p. II], but lose their beauty in the full laugh, as
fig. [109 L p. II], the expression of excessive laughter, oftener than
any other, gives a sensible face a silly or disagreeable
look, as it is apt to form regular plain lines about the
mouth, like a parenthesis, which sometimes appears like
crying; as, on the contrary, I remember to have seen
a beggar who had clouted up his head very artfully,
and whose visage was thin and pale enough to excite
pity, but his features were otherwise so unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
form'd for his purpose, that what he intended for a grin
of pain and misery, was rather a joyous laugh.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;">
<img src="images/108-109.jpg" width="452" height="212" alt="figs 108 and 109" />
</div>

<p>It is strange that nature hath afforded us so many
lines and shapes to indicate the deficiencies and blemishes
of the mind, whilst there are none at all that point out
the perfections of it beyond the appearance of common
sense and placidity. Deportment, words, and actions,
must speak the good, the wise, the witty, the humane,
the generous, the merciful, and the brave. Nor are
gravity and solemn looks always signs of wisdom: the
mind much occupied with trifles will occasion as grave
and sagacious an aspect, as if it were charged with matters
of the utmost moment; the balance-master's attention
to a single point, in order to preserve his balance,
may look as wise at that time as the greatest philosopher
in the depth of his studies. All that the ancient
sculptors could do, notwithstanding their enthusiastic
endeavours to raise the characters of their deities to aspects
of sagacity above human, was to give them features
of beauty. Their god of wisdom hath no more
in his look than a handsom manliness; the Jupiter is
carried somewhat higher, by giving it a little more severity
than the Apollo, by a larger prominency of brow
gently bending in seeming thoughtfulness, with an
ample beard, which being added to the noble quantity
of its other lines, invests that capital piece of sculpture
with uncommon dignity, which, in the mysterious language
of a profound connoisseur, is stiled a divine idea,
inconceivably great, and above nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>3dly and lastly, I shall shew in what manner the lines
of the face alter from infancy upwards, and specify the
different ages. We are now to pay most attention to
<i>simplicity</i>, as the difference of ages we are about to speak
of, turn chiefly upon the use made of this principle in
a greater or less degree, in the form of the lines.</p>

<p>From infancy till the body has done growing, the
contents both of the body and the face, and every part
of their surface, are daily changing into more variety,
till they obtain a certain medium (see page <a href="#Page_78">78</a> on proportion)
from which medium, as fig. [113 B p. II], if we return
back to infancy, we shall see the variety decreasing, till
by degrees that simplicity in the form, which gave variety
its due limits, deviates into sameness; so that all
the parts of the face may be circumscribed in several
circles, as fig. [116 L p. II].</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 536px;">
<img src="images/113-116.jpg" width="536" height="262" alt="figs 113 and 116" />
</div>

<p>But there is another very extraordinary circumstance,
(perhaps never taken notice of before in this light)
which nature hath given us to distinguish one age from
another by; which is, that tho' every feature grows
larger and longer, till the whole person has done growing,
the sight of the eye still keeps its original size; I
mean the pupil, with its iris or ring; for the diameter
of this circle continues still the same, and so becomes a
fixt measure by which we, as it were, insensibly compare
the daily perceiv'd growings of the other parts of
the face, and thereby determine a young person's age.
You may sometimes find this part of the eye in a new-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
infant, full as large as in a man of six foot; nay,
sometimes larger, see fig. [110 B p. II], [114 B p. II] and
[115 T p. I] which represents three different sizes of the
pupil of the eye; the least, was exactly taken from the eye of
a large-featur'd man, aged 105, the biggest, from one of twenty,
who had this part larger than ordinary, and the other is the
common size. If this part of the eye in the pictures of Charles
II. and James II. painted by Vandyke at Kensington, were to
be measured with a pair of compasses, and compared with their
pictures painted by Lilly when they were men, the diameters
would be found in both pictures respectively the same.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/110-114-115.jpg" width="500" height="167" alt="figs 110, 114 and 115" />
</div>

<p>In infancy the faces of boys and girls have no visible
difference, but as they grow up the features of the boy
get the start, and grow faster in proportion to the ring
of the eye, than those of the girl, which shews the distinction
of the sex in the face. Boys who have larger
features than ordinary, in proportion to the rings of their
eyes, are what we call manly-featured children; as those
who have the contrary, look more childish and younger
than they really are. It is this proportion of the features
with the eyes, that makes women, when they are
dressed in mens-cloaths, look so young and boyish: but
as nature doth not always stick close to these particulars,
we may be mistaken both in sexes and ages.</p>

<p>By these obvious appearances, and the differences of
the whole size, we easily judge of ages till twenty, but
not with such certainty afterwards; for the alterations
from that age are of a different kind, subject to other
changes by growing fatter or leaner, which it is well
known, often give a different turn to the look of the
person, with regard to his age.</p>

<p>The hair of the head, which encompasses a face as a
frame doth a picture, and contrasts with its uniform
colour, the variegated inclosed composition, adding
more or less beauty thereto, according as it is disposed
by the rules of art, is another indication of advanced
age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>What remains to be said on the different appearances
of ages, being less pleasing than what has gone before,
shall be described with more brevity. In the age from
twenty to thirty, barring accidents, there appears but
little change, either in the colours or the lines of the
face; for tho' the bloom tints may go off a little, yet
on the other hand, the make of the features often attain
a sort of settled firmness in them, aided by an air of
acquired sensibility; which makes ample amends for
that loss, and keeps beauty till thirty pretty much upon
a par; after this time, as the alterations grow more and
more visible, we perceive the sweet simplicity of many
rounding parts of the face, begin to break into dented
shapes, with more sudden turns about the muscles,
occasioned by their many repeated movements; as also
by dividing the broad parts, and thereby taking off
the large sweeps of the serpentine lines; the shades of
beauty also consequently suffering in their softnesses.
Something of what is here meant between the two ages
of thirty and fifty, see in figures [117 and 118 B p. II], and what further
havock time continues to make after the age of fifty, is
too remarkable to need describing: the strokes and cuts
he then lays on are plain enough; however, in spite of
all his malice, those lineaments that have once been
elegant, retain their flowing turns in venerable age,
leaving to the last a comely piece of ruins.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Attitude</span></i>.</h3>


<p>Such dispositions of the body and limbs as appear
most graceful when seen at rest, depend upon
gentle winding contrasts, mostly govern'd by the precise
serpentine line, which in attitudes of authority, are more
extended and spreading than ordinary, but reduced
somewhat below the medium of grace, in those of negligence
and ease: and as much exaggerated in insolent
and proud carriage, or in distortions of pain (see figure
9, plate I) as lessen'd and contracted into plain
and parallel lines, to express meanness, aukwardness, and
submission.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 258px;">
<img src="images/9.jpg" width="258" height="360" alt="9" />
</div>

<p>The general idea of an action, as well as of an
attitude, may be given with a pencil in very few lines.
It is easy to conceive that the attitude of a person upon
the cross, may be fully signified by the two straight lines
of the cross; so the extended manner of St. Andrew's
crucifixion is wholly understood by the X-like
cross.</p>

<p>Thus, as two or three lines at first are sufficient to
shew the intention of an attitude, I will take this opportunity
of presenting my reader (who may have been
at the trouble of following me thus far) with the sketch
of a country-dance, in the manner I began to set out
the design; in order to shew how few lines are necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to express the first thoughts, as to different attitudes;
see fig. [71 T p. II], which describe in some measure, the
several figures and actions, mostly of the ridiculous
kind, that are represented in the chief part of plate II.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="images/71.jpg" width="453" height="98" alt="71" />
</div>

<p>The most amiable person may deform his general
appearance by throwing his body and limbs into plain
lines, but such lines appear still in a more disagreeable
light in people of a particular make, I have therefore
chose such figures as I thought would agree best with
my first score of lines, fig. 71.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 751px;">
<img src="images/dancers.jpg" width="751" height="267" alt="the dancers" />
</div>

<p>The two parts of curves next to 71, served for the
figures of the old woman and her partner at the farther end
of the room. The curve and two straight lines at right
angles, gave the hint for the fat man's sprawling posture.
I next resolved to keep a figure within the bounds of a
circle, which produced the upper part of the fat woman,
between the fat man and the aukward one in the bag
wig, for whom I had made a sort of an X. The prim
lady, his partner, in the riding-habit, by pecking back
her elbows, as they call it, from the waste upwards,
made a tolerable D, with a straight line under it, to
signify the scanty stiffness of her peticoat; and a Z
stood for the angular position the body makes with the
legs and thighs of the affected fellow in the tye-wig;
the upper part of his plump partner was confin'd to an
O, and this chang'd into a P, served as a hint for the
straight lines behind. The uniform diamond of a card,
was filled up by the flying dress, &amp;c. of the little capering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
figure in the spencer-wig; whilst a double L mark'd
the parallel position of his poking partner's hands and
arms: and lastly, the two waving lines were drawn for
the more genteel turns of the two figures at the hither
end.</p>

<p>The best representation in a picture, of even the most
elegant dancing, as every figure is rather a suspended
action in it than an attitude, must be always somewhat
unnatural and ridiculous; for were it possible in a real
dance to fix every person at one instant of time, as in a
picture, not one in twenty would appear to be graceful,
tho' each were ever so much so in their movements;
nor could the figure of the dance itself be at all understood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 818px;">
<img src="images/paintings.jpg" width="818" height="343" alt="the pictures and statues" />
</div>

<p>The dancing-room is also ornamented purposely with
such statues and pictures as may serve to a farther illustration.
Henry viii. fig. [72 p. II], makes a perfect X with
his legs and arms; and the position of Charles the first,
fig. [51 p. II], is composed of less-varied lines than the statue of
Edward the sixth, fig. [73 p. II]; and the medal over his head
is in the like kind of lines; but that over Q. Elizabeth,
as well as her figure, is in the contrary; so are also
the two other wooden figures at the end. Likewise the
comical posture of astonishment (expressed by following
the direction of one plain curve, as the dotted line in a
french print of Sancho, where Don Quixote demolishes
the puppet shew, fig. [75 R p. II])is a good contrast to the effect
of the serpentine lines in the fine turn of the Samaritan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
woman, fig. [74 L p. II], taken from one of the best pictures Annibal
Carrache ever painted.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h4>

<h3><i>Of <span class="smcap">Action</span></i>.</h3>


<p>To the amazing variety of forms made still infinitely
more various in appearance by light, shade and colour,
nature hath added another way of increasing that
variety, still more to enhance the value of all her compositions.
This is accomplished by means of action;
the fullest display of which is put into the power of
the human species, and which is equally subject to the
same principles with regard to the effects of beauty, or
the reverse, as govern all the former compositions; as
is partly seen in <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">Chapter XI</a> on proportion. My business
here shall be, in as concise a manner as possible,
to particularise the application of these principles to the
movement of the body, and therewith finish this <i>system</i>
of variety in forms and actions.</p>

<p>There is no one but would wish to have it in his
power to be genteel and graceful in the carriage of his
person, could it be attained with little trouble and expence
of time. The usual methods relied on for this
purpose among well-bred people, takes up a considerable
part of their time: nay even those of the first rank
have no other resource in these matters, than to dancing-masters,
and fencing-masters: dancing and fencing are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
undoubtedly proper, and very necessary accomplishments;
yet are they frequently very imperfect in bringing
about the business of graceful deportment. For
altho' the muscles of the body may attain a pliancy by
these exercises, and the limbs, by the elegant movement
in dancing, acquire a facility in moving gracefully, yet
for want of knowing the meaning of every grace, and
whereon it depends, affectations and misapplications often
follow.</p>

<p>Action is a sort of language which perhaps one time
or other, may come to be taught by a kind of grammar-rules;
but, at present, is only got by rote and imitation:
and contrary to most other copyings or imitations,
people of rank and fortune generally excel their originals,
the dancing-masters, in easy behaviour and unaffected
grace; as a sense of superiority makes them act without
constraint; especially when their persons are well turn'd.
If so, what can be more conducive to that freedom
and necessary courage which make acquired grace seem
easy and natural, than the being able to demonstrate
<i>when</i> we are actually just and proper in the least movement
we perform; whereas, for want of such certainty
in the mind, if one of the most finish'd gentlemen at
court was to appear as an actor on the public stage, he
would find himself at a loss how to move properly, and
be stiff, narrow, and aukward, in representing even his
own character: the uncertainty of being right would
naturally give him some of that restraint which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
uneducated common people generally have when they
appear before their betters.</p>

<p>It is known that bodies in motion always describe
some line or other in the air, as the whirling round of a
fire-brand apparently makes a circle, the water-fall part
of a curve, the arrow and bullet, by the swiftness of their
motions, nearly a straight line; waving lines are formed
by the pleasing movement of a ship on the waves. Now
in order to obtain a just idea of action at the same time
to be judiciously satisfied of being in the right in what
we do, let us begin with imagining a line formed in the
air by any supposed point at the end of a limb or part
that is moved, or made by the whole part, or limb; or
by the whole body together. And that thus much of
movements may be conceived at once is evident, on the
least recollection, for whoever has seen a fine arabian
war-horse, unback'd and at liberty, and in a wanton
trot, cannot but remember what a large waving line his
rising, and at the same time pressing forward, cuts
through the air; the equal continuation of which, is
varied by his curveting from side to side; whilst his long
mane and tail play about in serpentine movements.</p>

<p>After thus having form'd the idea of all movements
being as lines, it will not be difficult to conceive, that
grace in action depends upon the same principles as
have been shewn to produce it in forms.</p>

<p>The next thing that offers itself to our consideration
is the force of <i>habit</i> and custom in action; for a great
deal depends thereon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The peculiar movements of each person, as the gate
in walking, are particularised in such lines as each part
describes by the habits they have contracted. The nature
and power of habit may be fully conceived by the following
familiar instance, as the motions of one part of
the body may serve to explain those of the whole.</p>

<p>Observe that whatever habit the fingers get in the
use of the pen, you see exactly delineated to the eye by
the shapes of the letters. Were the movements of every
writer's fingers to be precisely the same, one hand-writing
would not be known from another, but as the
fingers naturally fall into, or acquire different habits of
moving, every hand-writing is visibly different. Which
movements must tally with the letters, tho' they are too
quick and too small to be as perfectly traced by the eye;
but this shews what nice differences are caused, and
constantly retained by habitual movements.</p>

<p>It may be remark'd, that all useful habitual motions,
such as are readiest to serve the necessary purposes of
life, are those made up of plain lines, i. e. straight and
circular lines, which most animals have in common
with mankind, tho' not in so extensive a degree: the
monkey from his make hath it sufficiently in his power
to be graceful, but as reason is required for this purpose,
it would be impossible to bring him to move genteelly.</p>

<p>Though I have said that the ordinary actions of
the body are performed in plain lines, I mean only
comparatively so with those of studied movements in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
serpentine line, for as all our muscles are ever ready
to act, when one part is moved, (as an hand, or arm, by
its proper movers, for raising up or drawing down) the
adjacent muscles act in some degree in correspondence
with them: therefore our most common movements are
but seldom performed in such absolutely mean lines, as
those of jointed dolls and puppets. A man must have
a good deal of practice to be able to mimic such very
straight or round motions, which being incompatible
with the human form, are therefore ridiculous.</p>

<p>Let it be observed, that graceful movements in serpentine
lines, are used but occasionally, and rather at
times of leisure, than constantly applied to every action
we make. The whole business of life may be carried
on without them, they being properly speaking, only the
ornamental part of gesture; and therefore not being naturally
familiarised by necessity, must be acquired by
precept or imitation, and reduced to habit by frequent
repetitions. <i>Precept</i> is the means I should recommend
as the most expeditious and effectual way. But before
we proceed to the method I have to propose, for the
more ready and sure way of accustoming the limbs to
a facility in the ornamental way of moving; I should
observe, that quick time gives it spirit and vivacity, as
slow time, gravity, and solemnity, and further, that the
latter of these allows the eye an opportunity of seeing
the line of grace to advantage, as in the address of heroes
on the stage, or in any solemn act of ceremony;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and that although time in movement is reduced to certain
rules for dancing, it is left more at large and at
discretion for deportment.</p>

<p>We come now to offer an odd, but perhaps efficacious
method of acquiring a habit of moving in the lines
of grace and beauty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 234px;">
<img src="images/119-120.jpg" width="234" height="220" alt="119 120" />
</div>

<p>1. Let any one chalk the line fig. [119 L p. II], on a flat surface,
beginning at either end, and he will move his hand and
arm in a beautiful direction, but if he chalks the same
sort of line on an ogee-moulding of a foot or two in
breadth, as the dotted line on figure [120 L p. II], his hand must
move in that more beautiful direction, which is distinguished
by the name of grace; and according to the
quantity given to those lines, greatness will be added to
grace, and the movement will be more or less noble.</p>

<p>Gentle movements of this sort thus understood, may
be made at any time and any where, which by frequent
repetitions will become so familiar to the parts so exercised,
that on proper occasion they make them as it
were of their own accord.</p>

<p>The pleasing effect of this manner of moving the
hand, is seen when a snuff-box, or fan is presented
gracefully or genteely to a lady, both in the hand moving
forward and in its return, but care must be taken
that the line of movement be but gentle, as No. 3,
fig. 49, plate I, and not too S-like and twirling, as
No. 7 in the same figure: which excess would be affected
and ridiculous.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 272px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Daily practising these movements with the hands and
arms, as also with such other parts of the body as are
capable of them, will in a short time render the whole
person graceful and easy at pleasure.</p>

<p>2. As to the motions of the <i>head</i>; the awe most
children are in before strangers, till they come to a certain
age, is the cause of their dropping and drawing
their chins down into their breasts, and looking under
their foreheads, as if conscious of their weakness, or of
something wrong about them. To prevent this aukward
shyness, parents and tutors are continually teasing
them to hold up their heads, which if they get them to
do it is with difficulty, and of course in so constrain'd
a manner that it gives the children pain, so that they
naturally take all opportunities of easing themselves by
holding down their heads; which posture would be full
as uneasy to them were it not a relief from restraint:
and there is another misfortune in holding down the
head, that it is apt to make them bend too much in the
back; when this happens to be the case, they then have
recourse to steel-collars, and other iron-machines; all
which shacklings are repugnant to nature, and may
make the body grow crooked. This daily fatigue both
to the children and the parents may be avoided, and
an ugly habit prevented, by only (at a proper age)
fastening a ribbon to a quantity of platted hair, or to
the cap, so as it may be kept fast in its place, and the
other end to the back of the coat, as fig. [121 L p. II], of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
length as may prevent them drawing their chins into
their necks; which ribbon will always leave the head at
liberty to move in any direction but this aukward one
they are so apt to fall into.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 216px;">
<img src="images/121.jpg" width="216" height="255" alt="121" />
</div>

<p>But till children arrive at a reasoning age it will be
difficult by any means to teach them more grace than
what is natural to every well made child at liberty.</p>

<p>The grace of the upper parts of the body is most
engaging, and sensible well made people in any station
naturally have it in a great degree, therefore rules unless
they are simple and easily retain'd and practis'd, are of
little use; nay, rather are of disservice.</p>

<p>Holding the head erect is but occasionally right, a
proper recline of it may be as graceful, but true elegance
is mostly seen in the moving it from one position
to another.</p>

<p>And this may be attain'd by a sensibility within
yourself, tho' you have not a sight of what you do by
looking in the glass, when with your head assisted by
a sway of the body in order to give it more scope, you
endeavour to make that very serpentine line in the air,
which the hands have been before taught to do by the
help of the ogee-moulding: and I will venture to say, a
few careful repetitions at first setting out will make this
movement as easy to the head as to the hands and arms.</p>

<p>The most graceful bow is got by the head's moving
in this direction, as it goes downward and rises up again.
Some aukward imitators of this elegant way of bowing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
for want of knowing what they were about, have seem'd
to bow with wry necks. The low solemn bow to majesty
should have but a very little twist, if any, as more
becoming gravity and submission. The clownish nod
in a sudden straight line is quite the reverse of these
spoken of.</p>

<p>The most elegant and respectful curtesy hath a gentle,
or small degree of the above graceful bowing of the
head as the person sinks, and rises, and retreats.
If it should be said, that a fine curtesy consists in no more
than in being erect in person at the time of sinking and
rising; Madam Catherine in clock-work, or the dancing
bears led about the streets for a shew, must be allow'd
to make as good a curtesy as anybody.</p>

<p>N. B. It is necessary in bowing and curtesying to
shun an exact sameness at all times; for however graceful
it may be on some occasions, at other times it may
seem formal and improper. Shakespear seems to have
meant the above spoken of ornamental manner of bowing,
in Enobarbus's description of Cleopatra's waiting-women.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">

</p>

<p>3. Of <i>Dancing</i>. The minuet is allowed by the
dancing-masters themselves to be the perfection of all
dancing. I once heard an eminent dancing-master say,
that the minuet had been the study of his whole life,
and that he had been indefatigable in the pursuit of its
beauties, yet at last he could only say with Socrates, <i>he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
knew nothing</i>: adding, that I was happy in my profession
as a painter, in that some bounds might be set to
the study of it. No doubt, as the minuet contains in it
a composed variety of as many movements in the serpentine
lines as can well be put together in distinct
quantities, it is a fine composition of movements.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 418px;">
<img src="images/122.jpg" width="418" height="316" alt="122" />
</div>

<p>The ordinary undulating motion of the body in common
walking (as may be plainly seen by the waving line,
which the shadow a man's head makes against a wall as
he is walking between it and the afternoon sun) is augmented
in dancing into a larger quantity of <i>waving</i> by
means of the minuet-step, which is so contrived as to
raise the body by gentle degrees somewhat higher than
ordinary, and sink it again in the same manner lower in
the going on of the dance. The figure of the minuet-path
on the floor is also composed of serpentine lines,
as fig. [122 T p. II], varying a little with the fashion: when the
parties by means of this step rise and fall most smoothly
in time, and free from sudden starting and dropping,
they come nearest to Shakespear's idea of the beauty of
dancing, in the following lines,</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
&mdash;&mdash;What you do,<br />
Still betters what is done,&mdash;&mdash;<br />
&mdash;&mdash;When you do dance, I wish you<br />
A wave o' th' sea, that you might ever do<br />
Nothing but that; move still, still so,<br />
And own no other function.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Winter's Tale</span>.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The other beauties belonging to this dance, are the
turns of the head, and twist of the body in passing each
other, as also gentle bowing and presenting hands in
the manner before described, all which together, displays
the greatest variety of movements in serpentine
lines imaginable, keeping equal pace with musical time.</p>

<p>There are other dances that entertain merely because
they are composed of variety of movements and performed
in proper time, but the less they consist of serpentine
or waving lines, the lower they are in the
estimation of dancing-masters: for, as has been shewn,
when the form of the body is divested of its serpentine
lines it becomes ridiculous as a human figure, so likewise
when all movements in such lines are excluded
in a dance, it becomes low, grotesque and comical; but
however, being as was said composed of variety, made
consistent with some character, and executed with agility,
it nevertheless is very entertaining. Such are Italian
peasant-dances, &amp;c. But such uncouth contortions of
the body as are allowable in a man would disgust in a
woman; as the extreme graceful, so very alluring in this
sex, is nauseous in the other; even the minuet-grace in
a man would hardly be approved, but as the main drift
of it represents repeated addresses to the lady.</p>

<p>There is a much greater consistency in the dances of
the Italian theatre than of the French, notwithstanding
dancing seems to be the genius of that nation; the following
distinctly marked characters were originally from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Italy; and if we consider them lineally as to their particular
movements, we shall see wherein their humour
consists.</p>

<p>The attitudes of the harlequin are ingeniously
composed of certain little, quick movements of the
head, hands, and feet, some of which shoot out as it were
from the body in straight lines, or are twirled about in
little circles.</p>

<p>Scaramouch is gravely absurd as the character is intended,
in over-stretch'd tedious movements of unnatural
lengths of lines: these two characters seem to have
been contrived by conceiving a direct opposition of
movements.</p>

<p>Pierrott's movements and attitudes, are chiefly in
perpendiculars and parallels, so is his figure and dress.</p>

<p>Punchinello is droll by being the reverse of all elegance,
both as to movement, and figure, the beauty of
variety is totally, and comically excluded from this character
in every respect; his limbs are raised and let fall
almost altogether at one time, in parallel directions, as
if his seeming fewer joints than ordinary, were no better
than the hinges of a door.</p>

<p>Dances that represent provincial characters, as these
above do, or very low people, such as gardeners, sailors,
&amp;c. in merriment, are generally most entertaining on
the stage: the Italians have lately added great pleasantry
and humour to several french dances, particularly the
wooden-shoe dance, in which there is a continual shifting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
from one attitude in plain lines to another; both
the man and the woman often comically fix themselves
in uniform positions, and frequently start in equal time,
into angular forms, one of which remarkably represents
two W's in a line, as over figure 122, plate II, these
sort of dances a little raised, especially on the woman's
side, in expressing elegant wantonness (which is the true
spirit of dancing) have of late years been most delightfully
done, and seem at present to have got the better
of pompous unmeaning grand ballets; serious dancing
being even a contradiction in terms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/f.jpg" width="446" height="66" alt="fig. over 122" />
</div>

<p>4thly, Of <i>Country Dancing</i>. The lines which a
number of people together form in country or figure
dancing, make a delightful play upon the eye, especially
when the whole figure is to be seen at one view, as at
the playhouse from the gallery; the beauty of this kind
of mystic dancing, as the poets term it, depends upon
moving in a composed variety of lines, chiefly serpentine,
govern'd by the principles of intricacy, &amp;c. The
dances of barbarians are always represented without
these movements, being only composed of wild skiping,
jumping, and turning round, or running backward and
forward, with convulsive shrugs, and distorted gestures.</p>

<p>One of the most pleasing movements in country
dancing, and which answers to all the principles of varying
at once, is what they call the hay; the figure of it
altogether, is a cypher of S's, or a number of serpentine
lines interlacing, or intervolving each other, which suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
traced on the floor, the lines would appear as fig. [123 T p. II].
Milton in his Paradise lost, describing the angels dancing
about the sacred hill, pictures the whole idea in words;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
Mystical dance!&mdash;&mdash;<br />
&mdash;&mdash;Mazes intricate,<br />
Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular<br />
Then most, when most irregular they seem.<br />
</p>

<img src="images/123.jpg" width="449" height="164" alt="123" />
</div>

<p>I shall venture, lastly, to say a word or two of stage-action.
From what has been said of habitually moving
in waving lines, it may possibly be found that if
stage-action, particularly the graceful, were to be studied
lineally, it might be more speedily and accurately
acquired by the help of the foregoing principles than
the methods hitherto taken. It is known that common
deportment, such as may pass for elegant and proper off
the stage, would no more be thought sufficient upon it
than the dialogue of common polite conversation, would
be accurate or spirited enough for the language of a
play. So that trusting to chance only will not do.
The actions of every scene ought to be as much as possible
a compleat composition of well varied movements,
considered as such abstractedly, and apart from what may
be merely relative to the sense of the words. Action
consider'd with regard to assisting the authors meaning,
by enforcing the sentiments or raising the passions, must
be left entirely to the judgment of the performer, we
only pretend to shew how the limbs may be made to
have an equal readiness to move in all such directions
as may be acquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>What I would have understood by action, abstractedly
and apart from its giving force to the meaning of the
words, may be better conceived by supposing a foreigner,
who is a thorough master of all the effects of
action, at one of our theatres, but quite ignorant of the
language of the play; it is evident his sentiments under
such limitations, would chiefly arise from what he might
distinguish by the lines of the movements belonging
to each character; the actions of an old man, if proper,
or not, would be visible to him at once, and he would
judge of low and odd characters, by the inelegant
lines which we have already shewn to belong to the
characters of punch, harlequin, pierrott, or the clown;
so he would also form his judgment of the graceful
acting of a fine gentleman, or hero, by the elegance of
their movements in such lines of grace and beauty as
have been sufficiently described. See chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_V">V</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">VIII</a>,
on the composition of forms. Where note, that as the
whole of beauty depends upon <i>continually varying</i> the
same must be observed with regard to genteel and elegant
acting: and as plain space makes a considerable
part of beauty in form, so cessation of movement in
acting is as absolutely necessary; and in my opinion
much wanted on most stages, to relieve the eye from
what Shakespear calls, <i>continually sawing the air</i>.</p>

<p>The actress hath sufficient grace with fewer actions,
and those in less extended lines than the actor; for as
the lines that compose the Venus are simpler and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
gently flowing, than those that compose the Apollo,
so must her movements be in like proportion.</p>

<p>And here it may not be improper to take notice of
a mischief that attends copied actions on the stage; they
are often confin'd to certain sets and numbers, which
being repeated, and growing stale to the audience, become
at last subject to mimickry and ridicule, which
would hardly be the case, if an actor were possest of
such general principles as include a knowledge of the
effects of all the movements that the body is capable of.</p>

<p>The comedian, whose business it is to imitate the
actions belonging to particular characters in nature, may
also find his account in the knowledge of lines; for
whatever he copies from the life, by these principles may
be strengthened, altered, and adjusted as his judgment
shall direct, and the part the author has given him shall
require.</p>
